1
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,460
I'm sure that,

2
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:25,836
throughout the 100,000-odd years
of our species' existence

3
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,210
and even before,

4
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:33,939
our ancestors looked up at the night sky
and wondered what stars are --

5
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,253
wondering, therefore,

6
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:40,917
how to explain what they saw

7
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,382
in terms of things unseen.

8
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:52,430
OK, so, most people only wondered
that occasionally, like today,

9
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:56,930
in breaks from whatever
normally preoccupied them.

10
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:03,816
But what normally preoccupied them
also involved yearning to know.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,980
They wished they knew

12
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:10,673
how to prevent their food supply
from sometimes failing,

13
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:13,517
and how they could rest
when they were tired

14
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,935
without risking starvation,

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,523
be warmer, cooler, safer,

16
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:23,203
in less pain.

17
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:28,482
I bet those prehistoric cave artists
would have loved to know

18
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:29,941
how to draw better.

19
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,271
(Laughter)

20
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:34,375
In every aspect of their lives,

21
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:40,445
they wished for progress, just as we do.

22
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,177
But they failed, almost
completely, to make any.

23
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:49,487
They didn't know how to.

24
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:55,266
Discoveries like fire happened so rarely

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,632
that, from an individual's point of view,

26
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:00,471
the world never improved.

27
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,237
Nothing new was learned.

28
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,937
The first clue to the origin of starlight

29
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,415
happened as recently as 1899:

30
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,688
radioactivity.

31
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,490
And within 40 years,

32
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:20,306
physicists discovered
the whole explanation,

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,355
expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.

34
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,645
But never mind the symbols.

35
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:33,006
Think how many discoveries they represent.

36
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,341
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.

37
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,347
But isotopes,

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,403
particles of electricity,

39
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,096
antimatter,

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,071
neutrinos,

41
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:53,490
the conversion of mass
to energy -- that's E=mc2 --

42
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:54,750
gamma rays,

43
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,672
transmutation.

44
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,306
That ancient dream that had
always eluded the alchemists

45
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,584
was achieved through these same theories

46
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:11,306
that explained starlight
and other ancient mysteries

47
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,678
and new, unexpected phenomena.

48
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:18,675
That all that, discovered in 40 years,

49
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,907
had not been in the previous
hundred thousand

50
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:25,238
was not for lack of thinking

51
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:29,379
about stars and all those other
urgent problems they had.

52
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:34,387
They even arrived at answers,
such as myths,

53
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:36,563
that dominated their lives,

54
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:41,363
yet bore almost
no resemblance to the truth.

55
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,329
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation

56
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,795
isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.

57
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,056
These were people with brains
of essentially the same design

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,306
that eventually did discover
all those things.

59
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,077
But that ability to make progress

60
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,306
remained almost unused,

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,053
until the event that revolutionized
the human condition

62
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,703
and changed the universe.

63
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,060
Or so we should hope,

64
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:19,306
because that event
was the scientific revolution,

65
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,195
ever since which our knowledge
of the physical world

66
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:27,074
and of how to adapt it to our wishes

67
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,074
has been growing relentlessly.

68
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:32,184
Now, what had changed?

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,473
What were people now doing
for the first time

70
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:38,507
that made that difference
between stagnation

71
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,536
and rapid, open-ended discovery?

72
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,648
How to make that difference

73
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:48,129
is surely the most important
universal truth

74
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,797
that it's possible to know.

75
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:55,173
And worryingly, there's no consensus
about what it is.

76
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,005
So, I'll tell you.

77
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,060
(Laughter)

78
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,575
But I'll have to backtrack a little first.

79
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,399
Before the scientific revolution,

80
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:07,459
they believed that everything
important, knowable,

81
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,977
was already known,

82
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,684
enshrined in ancient
writings, institutions

83
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,744
and in some genuinely
useful rules of thumb --

84
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:19,010
which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,

85
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,921
along with many falsehoods.

86
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:25,673
So, they believed that knowledge
came from authorities

87
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:28,154
that actually knew very little.

88
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,126
And therefore,

89
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,784
progress depended
on learning how to reject

90
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:41,568
the authority of learned men,
the priests, traditions and rulers,

91
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:46,306
which is why the scientific revolution
had to have a wider context:

92
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,306
the Enlightenment, a revolution
in how people sought knowledge,

93
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,858
trying not to rely on authority.

94
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:58,597
"Take no one's word for it."

95
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:01,984
But that can't be
what made the difference.

96
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,961
Authorities had been rejected
before, many times.

97
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:07,009
And that rarely, if ever,

98
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,306
caused anything
like the scientific revolution.

99
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,340
At the time, what they thought
distinguished science

100
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:18,796
was a radical idea about things unseen,

101
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,433
known as empiricism --

102
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:24,794
all knowledge derives from the senses.

103
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:29,691
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.

104
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:35,415
It did help by promoting
observation and experiment.

105
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,698
But, from the outset,

106
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:40,421
it was obvious that there was something
horribly wrong with it.

107
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:42,400
Knowledge comes from the senses?

108
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,582
In what language?

109
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:48,152
Certainly not the language of mathematics,
in which, Galileo rightly said,

110
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,144
the book of nature is written.

111
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:52,710
Look at the world.

112
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:56,527
You don't see equations
carved on the mountainsides.

113
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,050
If you did, it would be because
people had carved them.

114
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,062
By the way, why don't we do that?

115
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,162
(Laughter)

116
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,695
What's wrong with us?

117
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,163
(Laughter)

118
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:09,826
Empiricism is inadequate

119
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,113
because, well, scientific theories
explain the seen in terms of the unseen.

120
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:18,722
And the unseen, you have to admit,

121
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,668
doesn't come to us through the senses.

122
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:24,435
We don't see those nuclear
reactions in stars.

123
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,901
We don't see the origin of species.

124
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:31,306
We don't see the curvature of space-time,

125
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,249
and other universes.

126
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,441
But we know about those things.

127
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,208
How?

128
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:43,947
Well, the classic empiricist
answer is induction --

129
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,306
the unseen resembles the seen.

130
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,390
But it doesn't.

131
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:54,402
You know what the clinching evidence was
that space-time is curved?

132
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:57,582
It was a photograph -- not of space-time,

133
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:01,743
but of an eclipse, with a dot
there rather than there.

134
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,598
And the evidence for evolution?

135
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,039
Some rocks and some finches.

136
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,090
And parallel universes?

137
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:11,770
Again: dots there
rather than there, on a screen.

138
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:14,404
What we see in all these cases

139
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:21,002
bears no resemblance to the reality
that we conclude is responsible --

140
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:27,030
only a long chain of theoretical reasoning
and interpretation connects them.

141
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:29,363
"Ah!" say creationists.

142
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,787
"So you admit it's all interpretation.

143
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,270
No one's ever seen evolution.

144
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:36,800
We see rocks.

145
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:39,253
You have your interpretation.
We have ours.

146
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:42,924
Yours comes from guesswork;
ours, from the Bible."

147
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:49,643
But what creationist
and empiricists both ignore

148
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,105
is that, in that sense,

149
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,853
no one's ever seen a Bible either,

150
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:58,549
that the eye only detects light,
which we don't perceive.

151
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:01,230
Brains only detect nerve impulses.

152
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,871
And they don't perceive even those
as what they really are,

153
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,095
namely electrical crackles.

154
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:11,862
So we perceive nothing
as what it really is.

155
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:16,418
Our connection to reality
is never just perception.

156
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:20,473
It's always, as Karl Popper put it,

157
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:21,973
theory-laden.

158
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,968
Scientific knowledge
isn't derived from anything.

159
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:30,081
Like all knowledge,
it's conjectural, guesswork,

160
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,570
tested by observation,

161
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:35,665
not derived from it.

162
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:40,449
So, were testable conjectures
the great innovation

163
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:44,306
that opened the intellectual prison gates?

164
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,416
No, contrary to what's usually said,
testability is common

165
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,783
in myths and all sorts of other
irrational modes of thinking.

166
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:57,451
Any crank claiming the sun
will go out next Tuesday

167
00:09:57,475 --> 00:10:00,022
has got a testable prediction.

168
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:05,376
Consider the ancient Greek myth
explaining seasons.

169
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,991
Hades, god of the underworld,

170
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:11,379
kidnaps Persephone, the goddess of spring,

171
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:17,262
and negotiates a forced marriage contract,
requiring her to return regularly,

172
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:18,657
and lets her go.

173
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,306
And each year,

174
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,259
she is magically compelled to return.

175
00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:25,306
And her mother, Demeter,

176
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,306
goddess of the earth,

177
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,116
is sad, and makes it cold and barren.

178
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,255
That myth is testable.

179
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,270
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,

180
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:43,306
then it must happen everywhere
on earth simultaneously.

181
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,407
So if the ancient Greeks had only known

182
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:49,811
that Australia is at its warmest
when Demeter is at her saddest ...

183
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:50,850
(Laughter)

184
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:53,051
they'd have known
that their theory is false.

185
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,107
(Laughter)

186
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:56,751
So, what was wrong with that myth

187
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:59,500
and with all prescientific thinking?

188
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:03,580
And what, then, made
that momentous difference?

189
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,018
I think there's one thing
you have to care about

190
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:13,105
and that implies testability,
the scientific method,

191
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,016
the Enlightenment and everything.

192
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,183
And here's the crucial thing:

193
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:20,120
there is such a thing
as a defect in a story.

194
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:21,928
I don't just mean a logical defect.

195
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:25,183
I mean a bad explanation.

196
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,609
What does that mean?

197
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:31,507
Well, an explanation is an assertion
about what's there, unseen,

198
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,306
that accounts for what's seen;

199
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,800
because the explanatory role
of Persephone's marriage contract

200
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,203
could be played equally well

201
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:45,280
by infinitely many other ad hoc entities.

202
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,875
Why a marriage contract
and not any other reason

203
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,090
for regular annual action?

204
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:55,306
Here's one: Persephone wasn't released.

205
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:01,631
She escaped, and returns every spring
to take revenge on Hades,

206
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,306
with her spring powers.

207
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,157
She cools his domain with spring air,

208
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:12,306
venting heat up to the surface,
creating summer.

209
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:16,803
That accounts for the same
phenomena as the original myth.

210
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,584
It's equally testable.

211
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:24,736
Yet what it asserts about reality
is, in many ways, the opposite.

212
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,223
And that's possible

213
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:31,243
because the details of the original myth
are unrelated to seasons,

214
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,006
except via the myth itself.

215
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,202
This easy variability

216
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:41,543
is the sign of a bad explanation,

217
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,869
because, without a functional reason

218
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:50,314
to prefer one of countless variants,

219
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,807
advocating one of them
in preference to the others

220
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,405
is irrational.

221
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,570
So, for the essence of what makes
the difference to enable progress,

222
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,929
seek good explanations,

223
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:05,402
the ones that can't be easily varied,

224
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,505
while still explaining the phenomena.

225
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:12,582
Now our current explanation of seasons

226
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,033
is that the Earth's axis
is tilted like that,

227
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:20,691
so each hemisphere tilts
towards the sun for half the year,

228
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,639
and away for the other half.

229
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,214
[Not to scale!]

230
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,404
Better put that up.

231
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:26,714
(Laughter)

232
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:29,978
That's a good explanation:

233
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,424
hard to vary,

234
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:34,538
because every detail
plays a functional role.

235
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:37,414
For instance, we know,
independently of seasons,

236
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:42,490
that surfaces tilted away
from radiant heat are heated less,

237
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,480
and that a spinning sphere, in space,

238
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,799
points in a constant direction.

239
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,632
And the tilt also explains

240
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:55,085
the sun's angle of elevation
at different times of year,

241
00:13:55,109 --> 00:14:00,125
and predicts that the seasons will be
out of phase in the two hemispheres.

242
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:02,465
If they'd been observed in phase,

243
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,475
the theory would have been refuted.

244
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:10,728
But now, the fact that it's also
a good explanation, hard to vary,

245
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,962
makes the crucial difference.

246
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:19,463
If the ancient Greeks had found out
about seasons in Australia,

247
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:23,387
they could have easily
varied their myth to predict that.

248
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,572
For instance, when Demeter's upset,

249
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:30,040
she banishes heat from her vicinity
into the other hemisphere,

250
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,447
where it makes summer.

251
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,306
So, being proved wrong by observation

252
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,873
and changing their theory accordingly

253
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:42,091
still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks
one jot closer to understanding seasons,

254
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,881
because their explanation
was bad -- easy to vary.

255
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,719
And it's only when an explanation is good

256
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:51,236
that it even matters
whether it's testable.

257
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,491
If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,

258
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:55,871
its defenders would have had
nowhere to go.

259
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,621
No easily implemented change

260
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:03,753
could make that tilt cause
the same seasons in both hemispheres.

261
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:11,491
The search for hard-to-vary explanations
is the origin of all progress.

262
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:16,028
It's the basic regulating principle
of the Enlightenment.

263
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:20,418
So, in science, two false
approaches blight progress.

264
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:23,306
One's well-known: untestable theories.

265
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,232
But the more important one
is explanationless theories.

266
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:31,812
Whenever you're told that some existing
statistical trend will continue

267
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:37,076
but you aren't given a hard-to-vary
account of what causes that trend,

268
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,217
you're being told a wizard did it.

269
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:42,061
When you are told
that carrots have human rights

270
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,183
because they share half our genes,

271
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:49,524
but not how gene percentages
confer rights -- wizard.

272
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:54,358
When someone announces
that the nature-nurture debate

273
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:55,595
has been settled

274
00:15:55,619 --> 00:16:00,104
because there's evidence that a given
percentage of our political opinions

275
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:02,306
are genetically inherited,

276
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,306
but they don't explain
how genes cause opinions,

277
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,500
they've settled nothing.

278
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:11,015
They're saying that our opinions
are caused by wizards,

279
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,763
and presumably, so are their own.

280
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:13,937
(Laughter)

281
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:20,862
That the truth consists
of hard-to-vary assertions about reality

282
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:24,726
is the most important fact
about the physical world.

283
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,970
It's a fact that is itself unseen,

284
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,688
yet impossible to vary.

285
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,901
Thank you.

286
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,330
(Applause)
