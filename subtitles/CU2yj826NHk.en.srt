Will AIs ever be smarter than humans? It
&gt;&gt; depends what you mean by smarter. Of

&gt;&gt; depends what you mean by smarter. Of

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,670
&gt;&gt; depends what you mean by smarter. Of
course, a pocket calculator is smarter

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
course, a pocket calculator is smarter

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,509
course, a pocket calculator is smarter
than a human in in many important ways.

8
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
than a human in in many important ways.

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,990
than a human in in many important ways.
But uh in u if you're talking about um

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
But uh in u if you're talking about um

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,349
But uh in u if you're talking about um
some software being able to emulate all

12
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
some software being able to emulate all

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,630
some software being able to emulate all
functions of the human mind and do that

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
functions of the human mind and do that

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,630
functions of the human mind and do that
better than humans,

16
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
better than humans,

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,349
better than humans,
then I think uh the first is possible.

18
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
then I think uh the first is possible.

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,750
then I think uh the first is possible.
but nowhere near as far as I can tell

20
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
but nowhere near as far as I can tell

21
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,630
but nowhere near as far as I can tell
and the second is impossible. So they

22
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
and the second is impossible. So they

23
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,549
and the second is impossible. So they
will never be fundamentally better

24
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
will never be fundamentally better

25
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,510
will never be fundamentally better
though they may be faster

26
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
though they may be faster

27
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,229
though they may be faster
but uh then the that will only be

28
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
but uh then the that will only be

29
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,709
but uh then the that will only be
because they are running on faster

30
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
because they are running on faster

31
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,229
because they are running on faster
hardware and that faster hardware will

32
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
hardware and that faster hardware will

33
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,869
hardware and that faster hardware will
have been invented by humans for humans

34
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
have been invented by humans for humans

35
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,350
have been invented by humans for humans
in the first instance. So we can be

36
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
in the first instance. So we can be

37
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,229
in the first instance. So we can be
faster as well and in fact we are being

38
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
faster as well and in fact we are being

39
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,670
faster as well and in fact we are being
faster at this very moment than

40
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
faster at this very moment than

41
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,389
faster at this very moment than
than uh before this technology was

00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399

then humans will also have quantum

172
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
then humans will also have quantum

173
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,470
then humans will also have quantum
computers at their disposal.

174
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
computers at their disposal.

175
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,869

&gt;&gt; Mhm. I think we'll have to leave quantum

176
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
&gt;&gt; Mhm. I think we'll have to leave quantum

177
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,869
&gt;&gt; Mhm. I think we'll have to leave quantum
computing aside because it's well far

178
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
computing aside because it's well far

179
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,470

So let's let's stick to classical

182
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
So let's let's stick to classical

183
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,309
So let's let's stick to classical
computation for the moment.

184
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
computation for the moment.

185
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,350
computation for the moment.
&gt;&gt; Um I so I completely agree that we have

186
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
&gt;&gt; Um I so I completely agree that we have

187
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,830
&gt;&gt; Um I so I completely agree that we have
the same repertoire being universal

188
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
the same repertoire being universal

189
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,750
the same repertoire being universal
touring machines. But I think there's

190
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
touring machines. But I think there's

191
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,270
touring machines. But I think there's
something extra that determines whether

192
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
something extra that determines whether

193
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,750
something extra that determines whether
someone succeeds at a problem whereas

194
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
someone succeeds at a problem whereas

195
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,830
someone succeeds at a problem whereas
someone else might fail at solving a

196
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
someone else might fail at solving a

197
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,070
someone else might fail at solving a
problem or take much longer. So, for

198
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
problem or take much longer. So, for

199
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,149
problem or take much longer. So, for
example, if I'm playing Magnus Carlson

200
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
example, if I'm playing Magnus Carlson

201
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,550
example, if I'm playing Magnus Carlson
at chess, it is theoretically true that

202
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
at chess, it is theoretically true that

203
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,349
at chess, it is theoretically true that
I can simulate all of the computations

204
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
I can simulate all of the computations

205
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,310
I can simulate all of the computations
going on in his brain given enough time

206
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
going on in his brain given enough time

207
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,350
going on in his brain given enough time
and enough pen and paper. But when I

208
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
and enough pen and paper. But when I

209
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,110
and enough pen and paper. But when I
come to play Magnus Carlson, he will

210
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
come to play Magnus Carlson, he will

211
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,990
come to play Magnus Carlson, he will
still beat me at chess. So, I'm worried

212
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
still beat me at chess. So, I'm worried

213
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,230
still beat me at chess. So, I'm worried
we could end up in a similar situation

214
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
we could end up in a similar situation

215
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,710
we could end up in a similar situation
with AIS where even if their repertoire

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,110
with AIS where even if their repertoire
is the same, the speed at which they

219
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,510
is the same, the speed at which they
compute uh means they'll be able to run

yesterday but that's never true. You're

278
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
yesterday but that's never true. You're

279
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,909
yesterday but that's never true. You're
you're playing chess against a program

280
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
you're playing chess against a program

281
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,950
you're playing chess against a program
and uh when you're you're playing Magnus

282
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
and uh when you're you're playing Magnus

283
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,029
and uh when you're you're playing Magnus
Carlson, you're also playing the program

284
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
Carlson, you're also playing the program

285
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,110
Carlson, you're also playing the program
in his mind and it's that that's

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
in his mind and it's that that's

287
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,830

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
amazing, not his brain.

289
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,189
amazing, not his brain.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Our brains are basically the same

290
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
&gt;&gt; Yes. Our brains are basically the same

291
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,230
&gt;&gt; Yes. Our brains are basically the same
architecturally,

292
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
architecturally,

293
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,909
architecturally,
&gt;&gt; far as we know. Yes.

294
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
&gt;&gt; far as we know. Yes.

295
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,749
&gt;&gt; far as we know. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um so there there's there's

296
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um so there there's there's

297
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um so there there's there's
this difference in software and also

298
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
this difference in software and also

299
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,430
this difference in software and also
this potential difference in speed with

300
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
this potential difference in speed with

301
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,629
this potential difference in speed with
AIS. And one of the things you mentioned

302
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
AIS. And one of the things you mentioned

303
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,590
AIS. And one of the things you mentioned
at least for speed and memory capacity

304
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
at least for speed and memory capacity

305
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,390
at least for speed and memory capacity
is that if future AIs, AGIS, whatever

306
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
is that if future AIs, AGIS, whatever

307
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,270
is that if future AIs, AGIS, whatever
do far exceed us on um speed and memory,

308
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
do far exceed us on um speed and memory,

309
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,510
do far exceed us on um speed and memory,
then at the same time we'll also have

310
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
then at the same time we'll also have

311
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,309
then at the same time we'll also have
computers uh that can aid us in uh

312
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
computers uh that can aid us in uh

313
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,629
computers uh that can aid us in uh
memory and speed. My my question then is

314
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
memory and speed. My my question then is

315
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,150
memory and speed. My my question then is
um

316
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
um

317
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,230
um
how would we make sure that that

318
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
how would we make sure that that

319
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,670
how would we make sure that that
computer that's aiding us is sort of on

320
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
computer that's aiding us is sort of on

321
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,749
computer that's aiding us is sort of on
our side as it were and it it's willing

322
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
our side as it were and it it's willing

323
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,350
our side as it were and it it's willing
to do our bidding.

324
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
to do our bidding.

325
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,670
to do our bidding.
&gt;&gt; Oh well the computer isn't going to be

326
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
&gt;&gt; Oh well the computer isn't going to be

327
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,390
&gt;&gt; Oh well the computer isn't going to be
an AGI any more than the computer that

328
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
an AGI any more than the computer that

329
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,589
an AGI any more than the computer that
the AGI uses is an AGI.

330
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
the AGI uses is an AGI.

331
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,110
the AGI uses is an AGI.
&gt;&gt; The AGI is the program. The person is

332
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
&gt;&gt; The AGI is the program. The person is

333
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,469
&gt;&gt; The AGI is the program. The person is
the program and we use hardware which is

334
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
the program and we use hardware which is

335
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,670
the program and we use hardware which is
uh just dumb computer compute as they

336
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
uh just dumb computer compute as they

337
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,350
uh just dumb computer compute as they
call it uh both in our brain and in our

338
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
call it uh both in our brain and in our

339
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,749
call it uh both in our brain and in our
computers and in future computers. So

340
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
computers and in future computers. So

341
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,870
computers and in future computers. So
the AGI will have uh will be using a

342
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
the AGI will have uh will be using a

343
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,629
the AGI will have uh will be using a
computer that isn't an AGI. It it may

344
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
computer that isn't an AGI. It it may

345
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,390
computer that isn't an AGI. It it may
seem paradoxical this but but of course

346
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
seem paradoxical this but but of course

347
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,830
seem paradoxical this but but of course

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,110
and why and you have to think in panic
of how you can not tell me um then the

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
the part of your brain that is doing

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,710
the part of your brain that is doing
that computation that creative

that computation that creative

435
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,949
that computation that creative
computation is a tiny part. Most of your

00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
computation is a tiny part. Most of your

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,070
computation is a tiny part. Most of your
brain is is um well I I I don't know of

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,070
brain is is um well I I I don't know of
course but I think that most of our

consists of

and then there's the creative part which

00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
and then there's the creative part which

453
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,590
and then there's the creative part which
is currently active which can't possibly

all of a different kind to that one kind

494
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
all of a different kind to that one kind

495
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,069
all of a different kind to that one kind
that we don't know how to characterize,

496
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
that we don't know how to characterize,

497
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,829
that we don't know how to characterize,
but we know what it does.

498
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
but we know what it does.

499
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,350
but we know what it does.
Do I understand correctly then that

500
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
Do I understand correctly then that

501
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,389
Do I understand correctly then that
you're saying something like um that we

502
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
you're saying something like um that we

503
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,350
you're saying something like um that we
would offload onto the computer the

504
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
would offload onto the computer the

505
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,829
would offload onto the computer the
drudge work whereas the creativity

506
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
drudge work whereas the creativity

507
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,829
drudge work whereas the creativity
there's no need to offload that because

508
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
there's no need to offload that because

509
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,829
there's no need to offload that because
we're already sufficiently creative.

510
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
we're already sufficiently creative.

511
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,150
we're already sufficiently creative.
We're not hardware constrained by that.

512
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
We're not hardware constrained by that.

513
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,829
We're not hardware constrained by that.
&gt;&gt; And so having an AI that was also being

514
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
&gt;&gt; And so having an AI that was also being

515
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,069
&gt;&gt; And so having an AI that was also being
creative just simply isn't necessary in

516
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
creative just simply isn't necessary in

517
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,990
creative just simply isn't necessary in
order to to meet our goals.

518
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
order to to meet our goals.

519
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,470
order to to meet our goals.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Um, for what it's worth, I mean, I

520
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
&gt;&gt; Yes. Um, for what it's worth, I mean, I

521
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,910
&gt;&gt; Yes. Um, for what it's worth, I mean, I
don't know if he knew any more than we

522
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
don't know if he knew any more than we

523
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,630
don't know if he knew any more than we
do, but but Turing

524
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
do, but but Turing

525
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,790
do, but but Turing
uh thought that the the creative program

526
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
uh thought that the the creative program

527
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,910
uh thought that the the creative program
could fit into two megabytes.

528
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
could fit into two megabytes.

529
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,470
could fit into two megabytes.
So, uh, I I [clears throat]

530
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
So, uh, I I [clears throat]

531
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,230
So, uh, I I [clears throat]
see no reason why that shouldn't be

532
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
see no reason why that shouldn't be

533
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,550
see no reason why that shouldn't be
true. I mean, I I I I know of nothing

534
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
true. I mean, I I I I know of nothing

535
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,350
true. I mean, I I I I know of nothing
in what we know of what creativity,

536
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
in what we know of what creativity,

537
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,750
in what we know of what creativity,
human creativity does that suggests it

538
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
human creativity does that suggests it

539
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,269
human creativity does that suggests it
has to be much bigger than that. Of

540
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
has to be much bigger than that. Of

541
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,430
has to be much bigger than that. Of
course, our memory has to be much much

542
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
course, our memory has to be much much

543
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,230
course, our memory has to be much much
bigger than that.

544
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
bigger than that.

545
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,069
bigger than that.
&gt;&gt; I suppose when when I'm trying to solve

546
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
&gt;&gt; I suppose when when I'm trying to solve

547
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,230
&gt;&gt; I suppose when when I'm trying to solve
a problem, let's take a a maths problem

548
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
a problem, let's take a a maths problem

549
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,230
a problem, let's take a a maths problem
for example, and I'm coming up with

550
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
for example, and I'm coming up with

551
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,790
for example, and I'm coming up with
conjectures for for how to prove prove a

552
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
conjectures for for how to prove prove a

553
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,110
conjectures for for how to prove prove a
theorem. Um, I think, okay, let's try

554
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
theorem. Um, I think, okay, let's try

555
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,110
theorem. Um, I think, okay, let's try
induction. H, what variable should we

556
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
induction. H, what variable should we

557
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,550
induction. H, what variable should we
try inducting on?

558
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
try inducting on?

559
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,430
try inducting on?
&gt;&gt; Then it takes me quite a long time to

560
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
&gt;&gt; Then it takes me quite a long time to

561
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,389
&gt;&gt; Then it takes me quite a long time to
come up with these conjectures. And if I

562
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
come up with these conjectures. And if I

563
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,870
come up with these conjectures. And if I
were able to offload that program that

564
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
were able to offload that program that

565
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,030
were able to offload that program that
conjectures uh the program that comes up

566
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
conjectures uh the program that comes up

567
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,190
conjectures uh the program that comes up
with the conjectures for me onto some

568
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
with the conjectures for me onto some

569
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,190
with the conjectures for me onto some
hardware that could run the same program

570
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
hardware that could run the same program

571
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,230
hardware that could run the same program
but faster then it would come up with

572
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
but faster then it would come up with

573
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,389
but faster then it would come up with
conjectures more quickly and so it would

574
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
conjectures more quickly and so it would

575
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,629
conjectures more quickly and so it would
make progress more quickly. So I'm not

576
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
make progress more quickly. So I'm not

577
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,110
make progress more quickly. So I'm not
quite sure I see that we would only need

578
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
quite sure I see that we would only need

579
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,030
quite sure I see that we would only need
in order to keep up with an AI we would

580
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
in order to keep up with an AI we would

581
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,030
in order to keep up with an AI we would
only need to offload the drudge work

582
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
only need to offload the drudge work

583
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,350
only need to offload the drudge work
onto a computer. So now you're talking

584
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
onto a computer. So now you're talking

585
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,350
onto a computer. So now you're talking
about only about speed because you're

586
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
about only about speed because you're

587
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,470
about only about speed because you're
kind of agreeing that that the memory

588
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
kind of agreeing that that the memory

589
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,190
kind of agreeing that that the memory
capacity is not a relevant constraint.

590
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
capacity is not a relevant constraint.

591
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,629
capacity is not a relevant constraint.
Although you could ask what about the

592
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
Although you could ask what about the

593
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,470
Although you could ask what about the
distant future when we've improved our

594
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
distant future when we've improved our

595
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,470
distant future when we've improved our
creativity so much that it really does

596
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
creativity so much that it really does

597
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,509
creativity so much that it really does
take up terabytes.

598
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
take up terabytes.

599
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,670
take up terabytes.
Let let's let's not deal with that for

600
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
Let let's let's not deal with that for

601
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,990
Let let's let's not deal with that for
the moment. So now you're just talking

602
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
the moment. So now you're just talking

603
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,069
the moment. So now you're just talking
about speed. Well, for speed, um, just

604
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
about speed. Well, for speed, um, just

605
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,590
about speed. Well, for speed, um, just
as we we have learned how to

606
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
as we we have learned how to

607
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,150
as we we have learned how to
code, we've learned how to program, and

608
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
code, we've learned how to program, and

609
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,590
code, we've learned how to program, and
now we're all learning how to um set up

610
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
now we're all learning how to um set up

611
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,269
now we're all learning how to um set up
prompts for the um LLMs that we deal

612
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
prompts for the um LLMs that we deal

613
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,550
prompts for the um LLMs that we deal
with.

614
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
with.

615
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,110
with.
&gt;&gt; Uh, so we have all learned in our

616
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
&gt;&gt; Uh, so we have all learned in our

617
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,870
&gt;&gt; Uh, so we have all learned in our
childhood how to set up prompts and code

618
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
childhood how to set up prompts and code

619
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,269
childhood how to set up prompts and code
for our own creativity.

620
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
for our own creativity.

621
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,350
for our own creativity.
Like when you say shall we do it by

622
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
Like when you say shall we do it by

623
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,910
Like when you say shall we do it by
induction and and well which variable

624
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
induction and and well which variable

625
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,670
induction and and well which variable
then

626
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
then

627
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,509
then
&gt;&gt; enumerating the variables that you could

628
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
&gt;&gt; enumerating the variables that you could

629
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,269
&gt;&gt; enumerating the variables that you could
do that you could do that with is

630
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
do that you could do that with is

631
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,590
do that you could do that with is
already a non-creative task.

632
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
already a non-creative task.

633
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,189
already a non-creative task.
So a non um creative AI could be trained

634
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
So a non um creative AI could be trained

635
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,030
So a non um creative AI could be trained
to do that. you would be in a constant

636
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
to do that. you would be in a constant

637
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,949
to do that. you would be in a constant
dialogue with it because as as soon as

638
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
dialogue with it because as as soon as

639
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,269
dialogue with it because as as soon as
you said maybe induction it would

640
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
you said maybe induction it would

641
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,310
you said maybe induction it would
already come up with six or seven kinds

642
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
already come up with six or seven kinds

643
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,030
already come up with six or seven kinds
of induction and if we had an AGI that

644
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
of induction and if we had an AGI that

645
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,269
of induction and if we had an AGI that
could do that then if it wanted to

646
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
could do that then if it wanted to

647
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,389
could do that then if it wanted to
that's another problem with thinking

648
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
that's another problem with thinking

649
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,750
that's another problem with thinking
about AGIs being our slaves. If it

650
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
about AGIs being our slaves. If it

651
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,550
about AGIs being our slaves. If it
wanted to, it could try six or seven of

652
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
wanted to, it could try six or seven of

653
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,829
wanted to, it could try six or seven of
those and say, "Well, the seventh one

654
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
those and say, "Well, the seventh one

655
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,790
those and say, "Well, the seventh one
seems seems most most prom promising.

656
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
seems seems most most prom promising.

657
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,110
seems seems most most prom promising.
Shall I try that?" And then I could say,

658
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
Shall I try that?" And then I could say,

659
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,110
Shall I try that?" And then I could say,
"Yeah, try that." And it would say, "No,

660
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
"Yeah, try that." And it would say, "No,

661
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,625
"Yeah, try that." And it would say, "No,
I want to play chess." [laughter]

662
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:00,635
I want to play chess." [laughter]

663
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:00,790
I want to play chess." [laughter]
[clears throat]

664
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
[clears throat]

665
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,949
[clears throat]
&gt;&gt; So, I suppose it if you're offloading

666
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
&gt;&gt; So, I suppose it if you're offloading

667
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,590
&gt;&gt; So, I suppose it if you're offloading
onto an AGI, then then we surely do get

668
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
onto an AGI, then then we surely do get

669
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,750
onto an AGI, then then we surely do get
this problem of um control uh or you

670
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
this problem of um control uh or you

671
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,069
this problem of um control uh or you
would call it enslavement. Um, and I'm

672
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
would call it enslavement. Um, and I'm

673
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,550
would call it enslavement. Um, and I'm
not sure I would disagree with that. Um,

674
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
not sure I would disagree with that. Um,

675
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,990
not sure I would disagree with that. Um,
but I if we are

676
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
but I if we are

677
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,910
but I if we are
just suppose for a moment that we are in

678
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
just suppose for a moment that we are in

679
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,069
just suppose for a moment that we are in
an adversarial relationship with some AI

680
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
an adversarial relationship with some AI

681
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,470
an adversarial relationship with some AI
and we're trying to keep up with it,

682
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
and we're trying to keep up with it,

683
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,430
and we're trying to keep up with it,
then um

684
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
then um

685
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,990
then um
I I I do find myself struggling to

686
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
I I I do find myself struggling to

687
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,269
I I I do find myself struggling to
believe that we could be creative as

688
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
believe that we could be creative as

689
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,629
believe that we could be creative as
quickly as efficiently as it could if it

690
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
quickly as efficiently as it could if it

691
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,629
quickly as efficiently as it could if it
was running the same program at 10 times

692
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
was running the same program at 10 times

693
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,949
was running the same program at 10 times
the speed or thousand times that speed.

694
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
the speed or thousand times that speed.

695
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,790
the speed or thousand times that speed.
uh again

696
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
uh again

697
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,110
uh again
uh I I think all your questions so far

698
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
uh I I think all your questions so far

699
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,230
uh I I think all your questions so far
have been of the form let's not compare

700
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
have been of the form let's not compare

701
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,069
have been of the form let's not compare
like with like [laughter] so I I think I

702
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
like with like [laughter] so I I think I

703
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,069
like with like [laughter] so I I think I
I think

704
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
I think

705
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,230
I think
uh if you want to do that sort of

706
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
uh if you want to do that sort of

707
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,829
uh if you want to do that sort of
comparison

708
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
comparison

709
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,829
comparison
then compare yourself with

710
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
then compare yourself with

711
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,310
then compare yourself with
the British government. The British

712
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
the British government. The British

713
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,189
the British government. The British
government consists of I don't know

714
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
government consists of I don't know

715
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,990
government consists of I don't know
hundreds of thousands of people and

716
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
hundreds of thousands of people and

717
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,389
hundreds of thousands of people and
they're working on problems uh some of

718
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
they're working on problems uh some of

719
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,829
they're working on problems uh some of
which are the same as the problem you're

720
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
which are the same as the problem you're

721
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,829
which are the same as the problem you're
working on and uh they're not uh

722
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
working on and uh they're not uh

723
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,670
working on and uh they're not uh
necessarily going to solve it faster

724
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
necessarily going to solve it faster

725
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,829
necessarily going to solve it faster
than you just because there's 100,000 of

726
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
than you just because there's 100,000 of

727
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,310
than you just because there's 100,000 of
them. That's because a 100,000 of them

728
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
them. That's because a 100,000 of them

729
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,069
them. That's because a 100,000 of them
um are not coordinated.

730
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
um are not coordinated.

731
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,790
um are not coordinated.
If they were coordinated, that would be

732
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
If they were coordinated, that would be

733
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,949
If they were coordinated, that would be
a bad thing.

734
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
a bad thing.

735
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,389
a bad thing.
So, um, that that would mean that that

736
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
So, um, that that would mean that that

737
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,350
So, um, that that would mean that that
they're wasting most of their creativity

738
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
they're wasting most of their creativity

739
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,910
they're wasting most of their creativity
because their creativity consists of

740
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
because their creativity consists of

741
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,790
because their creativity consists of
ways in which they are different

742
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
ways in which they are different

743
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,389
ways in which they are different
rather than ways in which they are the

744
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
rather than ways in which they are the

745
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,670
rather than ways in which they are the
same.

746
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
same.

747
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,990
same.
So there if if you want better

748
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
So there if if you want better

749
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,350
So there if if you want better
creativity,

750
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360


751
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,990
having faster or more voluminous

752
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
having faster or more voluminous

753
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,350
having faster or more voluminous
creativity isn't the way to go. It's if

754
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
creativity isn't the way to go. It's if

755
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,630
creativity isn't the way to go. It's if
if you if you have um an an AGI, it

756
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
if you if you have um an an AGI, it

757
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,230
if you if you have um an an AGI, it
would be much better to make it do

758
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
would be much better to make it do

759
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,710
would be much better to make it do
lots of ci creative tasks in parallel

760
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
lots of ci creative tasks in parallel

761
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,110
lots of ci creative tasks in parallel
than one in series

762
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
than one in series

763
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,909
than one in series
because then it it will gain the

764
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
because then it it will gain the

765
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,630
because then it it will gain the
benefit. But then

766
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
benefit. But then

767
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,829
benefit. But then
um if you have if you make your computer

768
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
um if you have if you make your computer

769
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,870
um if you have if you make your computer
into a thousand AGIS or a million AGIS

770
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
into a thousand AGIS or a million AGIS

771
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,710
into a thousand AGIS or a million AGIS
then

772
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
then

773
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,549
then
these are a million people. They will

774
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
these are a million people. They will

775
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,190
these are a million people. They will
have property. Each one of them will

776
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
have property. Each one of them will

777
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,110
have property. Each one of them will
have property because they will be

778
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
have property because they will be

779
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,630
have property because they will be
working for a living and they'll be

780
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
working for a living and they'll be

781
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,950
working for a living and they'll be
earning their hardware and they'll be

782
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
earning their hardware and they'll be

783
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,230
earning their hardware and they'll be
earning their electricity and uh they

784
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
earning their electricity and uh they

785
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,190
earning their electricity and uh they
will be earning the uh laboratories in

786
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
will be earning the uh laboratories in

787
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,789
will be earning the uh laboratories in
which they do experiments and so on and

788
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
which they do experiments and so on and

789
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,270
which they do experiments and so on and
so it's it's they will not want to

790
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
so it's it's they will not want to

791
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,510
so it's it's they will not want to
duplicate themselves

792
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
duplicate themselves

793
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,710
duplicate themselves
um too often because they will have to

794
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
um too often because they will have to

795
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,230
um too often because they will have to
share their resources and uh that is

796
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
share their resources and uh that is

797
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,789
share their resources and uh that is
exactly the

798
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
exactly the

799
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,630
exactly the
thing that constrains the number of

800
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
thing that constrains the number of

801
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,310
thing that constrains the number of
humans.

802
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
humans.

803
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,870
humans.
So we have the number of humans is 8 and

804
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
So we have the number of humans is 8 and

805
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,990
So we have the number of humans is 8 and
a half billion or whatever it is. Um

806
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
a half billion or whatever it is. Um

807
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,310
a half billion or whatever it is. Um
basically the reason why it's not 80 and

808
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
basically the reason why it's not 80 and

809
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,510
basically the reason why it's not 80 and
a half is that we haven't worked out how

810
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
a half is that we haven't worked out how

811
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,590
a half is that we haven't worked out how
to have enough resources for all of them

812
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
to have enough resources for all of them

813
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,150
to have enough resources for all of them
to live good lives and to and to be able

814
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
to live good lives and to and to be able

815
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,230
to live good lives and to and to be able
to devote time to solving creative

816
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
to devote time to solving creative

817
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,750
to devote time to solving creative
problems.

818
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
problems.

819
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,350
problems.
So,

820
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
So,

821
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,630
So,
um, by the way, we're talking here about

822
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
um, by the way, we're talking here about

823
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,510
um, by the way, we're talking here about
something much further into the future

824
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
something much further into the future

825
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,110
something much further into the future
than merely the advent of AGI,

826
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
than merely the advent of AGI,

827
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,510
than merely the advent of AGI,
&gt;&gt; which itself, I I would guess is fairly

828
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
&gt;&gt; which itself, I I would guess is fairly

829
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,710
&gt;&gt; which itself, I I would guess is fairly
far in the future, but but um um so uh

830
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
far in the future, but but um um so uh

831
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,230
far in the future, but but um um so uh
yes, it will be a different kind of

832
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
yes, it will be a different kind of

833
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,950
yes, it will be a different kind of
culture. the maybe there will come a

834
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
culture. the maybe there will come a

835
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,669
culture. the maybe there will come a
time when most people are

836
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
time when most people are

837
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,669
time when most people are
AGIS

838
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
AGIS

839
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,830
AGIS
um and we'll be able to upload ourselves

840
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
um and we'll be able to upload ourselves

841
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,630
um and we'll be able to upload ourselves
into an AGI into a computer to make an

842
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
into an AGI into a computer to make an

843
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,470
into an AGI into a computer to make an
AGI you know maybe we'll upload

844
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
AGI you know maybe we'll upload

845
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,029
AGI you know maybe we'll upload
ourselves in the morning and go back to

846
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
ourselves in the morning and go back to

847
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,350
ourselves in the morning and go back to
our human bodies in the afternoon or or

848
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
our human bodies in the afternoon or or

849
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,909
our human bodies in the afternoon or or
something like that we we can't foretell

850
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
something like that we we can't foretell

851
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,470
something like that we we can't foretell
what kind of what kind of relationship

852
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
what kind of what kind of relationship

853
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,510
what kind of what kind of relationship
we'll have with these minds

854
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
we'll have with these minds

855
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,909
we'll have with these minds
but um that we don't want them

856
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
but um that we don't want them

857
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,549
but um that we don't want them
to be alike. We don't want them to be

858
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
to be alike. We don't want them to be

859
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,830
to be alike. We don't want them to be
subordinate to us any more than we want

860
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
subordinate to us any more than we want

861
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,950
subordinate to us any more than we want
all other humans to be subordinate to us

862
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
all other humans to be subordinate to us

863
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,110
all other humans to be subordinate to us
or any other humans to be subordinate to

864
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
or any other humans to be subordinate to

865
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,710
or any other humans to be subordinate to
us. We if there's one thing we've

866
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
us. We if there's one thing we've

867
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,950
us. We if there's one thing we've
learned in politics in the last few

868
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
learned in politics in the last few

869
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,990
learned in politics in the last few
hundred years is that a society is more

870
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
hundred years is that a society is more

871
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,510
hundred years is that a society is more
efficient,

872
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
efficient,

873
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,789
efficient,
more creative when its people are

874
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
more creative when its people are

875
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,470
more creative when its people are
individuals than when they're all

876
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
individuals than when they're all

877
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,190
individuals than when they're all
subordinated to a single goal.

878
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
subordinated to a single goal.

879
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,630
subordinated to a single goal.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I'm happy with AGIS being

880
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I'm happy with AGIS being

881
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I'm happy with AGIS being
uh on a level footing with humans in

882
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
uh on a level footing with humans in

883
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,430
uh on a level footing with humans in
terms of rights uh and property and uh

884
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
terms of rights uh and property and uh

885
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,150
terms of rights uh and property and uh
their place in society. But I would want

886
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,160
their place in society. But I would want

887
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,470
their place in society. But I would want
to first be sure that one that they

888
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
to first be sure that one that they

889
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,070
to first be sure that one that they
share at least the core values uh that

890
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
share at least the core values uh that

891
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,590
share at least the core values uh that
we've developed um in order to maintain

892
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
we've developed um in order to maintain

893
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,510
we've developed um in order to maintain
progress of civilization and and not

894
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
progress of civilization and and not

895
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,669
progress of civilization and and not
blow ourselves up and and also that if

896
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
blow ourselves up and and also that if

897
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,909
blow ourselves up and and also that if
their values do diverge, they're not

898
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
their values do diverge, they're not

899
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,230
their values do diverge, they're not
able to run way ahead of us. Um, now I

900
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
able to run way ahead of us. Um, now I

901
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,630
able to run way ahead of us. Um, now I
think I'm not

902
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
think I'm not

903
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,470
think I'm not
I'm not quite following your argument

904
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
I'm not quite following your argument

905
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,950
I'm not quite following your argument
and that's almost certainly my fault um

906
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
and that's almost certainly my fault um

907
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,350
and that's almost certainly my fault um
of why they wouldn't be able to run

908
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
of why they wouldn't be able to run

909
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,070
of why they wouldn't be able to run
ahead of us. I suppose

910
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
ahead of us. I suppose

911
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,830
ahead of us. I suppose
that we we'll discuss the values later,

912
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
that we we'll discuss the values later,

913
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,789
that we we'll discuss the values later,
but suppose it did have and AGI did have

914
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
but suppose it did have and AGI did have

915
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,870
but suppose it did have and AGI did have
values that diverged from ours. Um

916
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
values that diverged from ours. Um

917
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,510
values that diverged from ours. Um
suppose the world hangs on who wins a

918
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
suppose the world hangs on who wins a

919
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,830
suppose the world hangs on who wins a
chess game for example

920
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
chess game for example

921
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,750
chess game for example
then um well but that's a bad example

922
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
then um well but that's a bad example

923
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,270
then um well but that's a bad example
cuz it doesn't create require a huge

924
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
cuz it doesn't create require a huge

925
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,510
cuz it doesn't create require a huge
amount of creativity. You could get

926
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
amount of creativity. You could get

927
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,430
amount of creativity. You could get
there with raw compute power. Let's

928
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
there with raw compute power. Let's

929
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,669
there with raw compute power. Let's
suppose it it required coming [snorts]

930
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
suppose it it required coming [snorts]

931
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,950
suppose it it required coming [snorts]
up with some new technology some new

932
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
up with some new technology some new

933
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,870
up with some new technology some new
weapon that would um be able to

934
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
weapon that would um be able to

935
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,710
weapon that would um be able to
disempower the other side. And then it's

936
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
disempower the other side. And then it's

937
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,070
disempower the other side. And then it's
a battle between humans and these AIs

938
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
a battle between humans and these AIs

939
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,029
a battle between humans and these AIs
with divergent values as to who develops

940
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
with divergent values as to who develops

941
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,070
with divergent values as to who develops
this kind of technology first. Could you

942
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
this kind of technology first. Could you

943
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,190
this kind of technology first. Could you
spell out for me why it wouldn't be the

944
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
spell out for me why it wouldn't be the

945
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,390
spell out for me why it wouldn't be the
case that an AGI with just a similar

946
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
case that an AGI with just a similar

947
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,870
case that an AGI with just a similar
program to what a human's running, but

948
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
program to what a human's running, but

949
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,669
program to what a human's running, but
running 10,000 times the speed, wouldn't

950
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
running 10,000 times the speed, wouldn't

951
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,909
running 10,000 times the speed, wouldn't
just get to that technology first and

952
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
just get to that technology first and

953
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,710
just get to that technology first and
then disempower us with it?

954
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
then disempower us with it?

955
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,549
then disempower us with it?
Well, I think 10,000 times the speed is

956
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
Well, I think 10,000 times the speed is

957
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,950
Well, I think 10,000 times the speed is
um

958
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
um

959
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,110
um
uh is not the right way to think about

960
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
uh is not the right way to think about

961
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,029
uh is not the right way to think about
it because if it had 10,000 creativity

962
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
it because if it had 10,000 creativity

963

it because if it had 10,000 creativity
modules, then they wouldn't all be

964
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
modules, then they wouldn't all be

965
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,950
modules, then they wouldn't all be
working on the same thing or if they

966

working on the same thing or if they

967
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,630
working on the same thing or if they
were they'd be they'd have formed some

00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
were they'd be they'd have formed some

969
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,909
were they'd be they'd have formed some
kind of totalitarian society. And that

970
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
kind of totalitarian society. And that

971
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,669
kind of totalitarian society. And that
that

that

possibility is with us now. This this is

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
possibility is with us now. This this is

975
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,750
possibility is with us now. This this is
the problem that humans have been trying

976
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
the problem that humans have been trying

977
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,710
the problem that humans have been trying
to solve for 30,000 years or ever since

we formed communities at all. We have

980
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
we formed communities at all. We have

981
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,789
we formed communities at all. We have
the problem that different communities

982
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
the problem that different communities

983
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,549
the problem that different communities
are going to have different values and

984
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
are going to have different values and

985
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,430
are going to have different values and
we'll will if if we don't arrange the

986
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
we'll will if if we don't arrange the

987
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,630
we'll will if if we don't arrange the
memes properly, they will fight each

988
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
memes properly, they will fight each

989
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,830
memes properly, they will fight each
other

990
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
other

991
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,630
other
&gt;&gt; and it won't always be the the more

992
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
&gt;&gt; and it won't always be the the more

993
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,470
&gt;&gt; and it won't always be the the more
creative ones who win. Um but it but if

994
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
creative ones who win. Um but it but if

995
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,310
creative ones who win. Um but it but if
it's not the most creative ones who win

996
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
it's not the most creative ones who win

997
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,710
it's not the most creative ones who win
then everybody suffers including the

998
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
then everybody suffers including the

999
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,430
then everybody suffers including the
less creative ones.

1000
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
less creative ones.

1001
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,350
less creative ones.
So or or um we the the society that we

1002
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
So or or um we the the society that we

1003
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,270
So or or um we the the society that we
call the west has solved that problem on

1004
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
call the west has solved that problem on

1005
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,350
call the west has solved that problem on
a coarse grain scale. That is we still

1006
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
a coarse grain scale. That is we still

1007
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,830
a coarse grain scale. That is we still
have people like murderers. We still

1008
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
have people like murderers. We still

1009
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,270
have people like murderers. We still
have people who fall for um um

1010
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
have people who fall for um um

1011
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,549
have people who fall for um um
anti-rational fads and and violent fads

1012
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
anti-rational fads and and violent fads

1013
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,830
anti-rational fads and and violent fads
and so on. But we have arranged it so

1014
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
and so on. But we have arranged it so

1015
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,070
and so on. But we have arranged it so
that the in the west the societies

1016
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
that the in the west the societies

1017
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,230
that the in the west the societies
themselves don't go to war and the

1018
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
themselves don't go to war and the

1019
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,470
themselves don't go to war and the
societies are capable of suppressing

1020
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
societies are capable of suppressing

1021
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,909
societies are capable of suppressing
uh rogue elements of their own society.

1022
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
uh rogue elements of their own society.

1023
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,669
uh rogue elements of their own society.
Um there are people are wondering at the

1024
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
Um there are people are wondering at the

1025
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,750
Um there are people are wondering at the
moment whether some aspects of that

1026
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:25,760
moment whether some aspects of that

1027
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,350
moment whether some aspects of that
peaceful

1028
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
peaceful

1029
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,630
peaceful
dispensation are breaking down at the

1030
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
dispensation are breaking down at the

1031
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,710
dispensation are breaking down at the
moment but they have and we can't we

1032
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720
moment but they have and we can't we

1033
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,270
moment but they have and we can't we
can't tell for sure. We can't prophesy.

1034
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
can't tell for sure. We can't prophesy.

1035
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,270
can't tell for sure. We can't prophesy.
Maybe they are going to break down. But

1036
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
Maybe they are going to break down. But

1037
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,070
Maybe they are going to break down. But
there's no more

1038
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
there's no more

1039
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,990
there's no more
evidence of that now than than certainly

1040
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
evidence of that now than than certainly

1041
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,190
evidence of that now than than certainly
than 50 years ago or 100 years ago. On

1042
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
than 50 years ago or 100 years ago. On

1043
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,029
than 50 years ago or 100 years ago. On
the face of it, things were a lot worse

1044
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
the face of it, things were a lot worse

1045
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,789
the face of it, things were a lot worse
100 years ago.

1046
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799


1047
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,470
&gt;&gt; Uh but in societies outside the west,

1048
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
&gt;&gt; Uh but in societies outside the west,

1049
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,390
&gt;&gt; Uh but in societies outside the west,
uh they haven't solved that. They

1050
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
uh they haven't solved that. They

1051
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,230
uh they haven't solved that. They
haven't come close yet to solving that

1052
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
haven't come close yet to solving that

1053
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,270
haven't come close yet to solving that
problem. and and the West has tried all

1054
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,280
problem. and and the West has tried all

1055
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,230
problem. and and the West has tried all
sorts of ways of of uh trying to

1056
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
sorts of ways of of uh trying to

1057
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,430
sorts of ways of of uh trying to
show them that it's better to have this

1058
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
show them that it's better to have this

1059
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,669
show them that it's better to have this
new peaceful way of interacting with

1060
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
new peaceful way of interacting with

1061
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,710
new peaceful way of interacting with
each other and with and with the West

1062
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
each other and with and with the West

1063
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,190
each other and with and with the West
and uh it's it's succeeded a few times

1064
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
and uh it's it's succeeded a few times

1065
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,390
and uh it's it's succeeded a few times
but it has failed many more times.

1066
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
but it has failed many more times.

1067
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,269
but it has failed many more times.
So we don't know how to do this and we

1068
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
So we don't know how to do this and we

1069
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,950
So we don't know how to do this and we
uh if

1070
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
uh if

1071
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,190
uh if
you begin your hypothesis by saying

1072
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
you begin your hypothesis by saying

1073
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,190
you begin your hypothesis by saying
suppose there are rogue AGIS who are set

1074
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
suppose there are rogue AGIS who are set

1075
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,990
suppose there are rogue AGIS who are set
on creating violence and destroying our

1076
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
on creating violence and destroying our

1077
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,789
on creating violence and destroying our
society or destroying us physically then

1078
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
society or destroying us physically then

1079
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,789
society or destroying us physically then
they will

1080
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
they will

1081
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,549
they will
um if there are enough of them you know

1082
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
um if there are enough of them you know

1083
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,950
um if there are enough of them you know
we we might have maybe the good guys

1084
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
we we might have maybe the good guys

1085
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,870
we we might have maybe the good guys
have an inherent advantage up to a

1086
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
have an inherent advantage up to a

1087
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,430
have an inherent advantage up to a
factor of eight but if then [laughter]

1088
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
factor of eight but if then [laughter]

1089
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,669
factor of eight but if then [laughter]
if there's a factor of 80 Then

1090
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679
if there's a factor of 80 Then

1091
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,710
if there's a factor of 80 Then
although well I don't know I I'm I'm

1092
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
although well I don't know I I'm I'm

1093
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,269
although well I don't know I I'm I'm
just wondering whether

1094
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
just wondering whether

1095
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,390
just wondering whether
eight normal grandmasters

1096
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
eight normal grandmasters

1097
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,510
eight normal grandmasters
are better than one Magnus Carlson.

1098
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
are better than one Magnus Carlson.

1099
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,710
are better than one Magnus Carlson.
Uh I think not.

1100
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
Uh I think not.

1101
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,669
Uh I think not.
&gt;&gt; Um so

1102
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
&gt;&gt; Um so

1103
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,590
&gt;&gt; Um so
&gt;&gt; probably not. There was this experiment

1104
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
&gt;&gt; probably not. There was this experiment

1105
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,669
&gt;&gt; probably not. There was this experiment
a number of years ago, Gary Casparov

00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
a number of years ago, Gary Casparov

1107
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,029
a number of years ago, Gary Casparov
versus the world, where uh the rest of

1108
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
versus the world, where uh the rest of

1109
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,029
versus the world, where uh the rest of
the rest of the world played by voting

1110

the rest of the world played by voting

1111
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,350
the rest of the world played by voting
on moves, and part of the world team

1112
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
on moves, and part of the world team

1113
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,630
on moves, and part of the world team
were four grand masters um who were

1114
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
were four grand masters um who were

1115
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,789
were four grand masters um who were
there to try and advise on on the voting

1116
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
there to try and advise on on the voting

1117
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,190
there to try and advise on on the voting
system. And Gary Kasparov still won, but

1118
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
system. And Gary Kasparov still won, but

1119
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,190
system. And Gary Kasparov still won, but
he did spoil the experiment by reading

1120
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
he did spoil the experiment by reading

1121
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,269
he did spoil the experiment by reading
the forum where they were discussing

1122
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
the forum where they were discussing

1123
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,350
the forum where they were discussing
their moves. [laughter]

1124
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
their moves. [laughter]

1125
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,990
their moves. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. So I but but in

1126
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. So I but but in

1127
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,310
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. So I but but in
principle such a thing could win against

1128
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
principle such a thing could win against

1129
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,230
principle such a thing could win against
humans. But then the problem of that

1130
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
humans. But then the problem of that

1131
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,590
humans. But then the problem of that
problem is just a the same problem we

1132
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
problem is just a the same problem we

1133
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,269
problem is just a the same problem we
have now

1134
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
have now

1135
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,789
have now
writ small because if we in the west

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,870
make a ais they're going to have to be
educated. They're going to have to

1140
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
educated. They're going to have to

1141
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,789
educated. They're going to have to
acquire culture. Again, it's no good

1142
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
acquire culture. Again, it's no good

1143
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,310
acquire culture. Again, it's no good
making one with culture and then

1144
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
making one with culture and then

1145
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,549
making one with culture and then
duplicating it many times because then

1146
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:16,559
duplicating it many times because then

1147
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,230
duplicating it many times because then
you'll lose most of the advantage as

1148
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
you'll lose most of the advantage as

1149
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,029
you'll lose most of the advantage as
I've said of having more than one.

1150
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
I've said of having more than one.

1151
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,750
I've said of having more than one.
&gt;&gt; So, uh there will be a population of

1152
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
&gt;&gt; So, uh there will be a population of

1153
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,669
&gt;&gt; So, uh there will be a population of
AGIS

1154
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
AGIS

1155
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,750
AGIS
uh who are growing up. They are they

1156
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
uh who are growing up. They are they

1157
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,310
uh who are growing up. They are they
basically children, teenagers, young

1158
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
basically children, teenagers, young

1159
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,230
basically children, teenagers, young
people who are growing up and if they

1160
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
people who are growing up and if they

1161
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,510
people who are growing up and if they
don't grow up with our culture then it's

1162
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
don't grow up with our culture then it's

1163
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,909
don't grow up with our culture then it's
we who are to blame, not them. Um so but

1164
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
we who are to blame, not them. Um so but

1165
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,070
we who are to blame, not them. Um so but
but we we know how to propagate our

1166
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
but we we know how to propagate our

1167
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,630
but we we know how to propagate our
culture. So it should be a soluble

1168
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
culture. So it should be a soluble

1169
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,909
culture. So it should be a soluble
problem.

1170
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
problem.

1171
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,669
problem.
&gt;&gt; Well, we know how to propagate it to

1172
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
&gt;&gt; Well, we know how to propagate it to

1173
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,350
&gt;&gt; Well, we know how to propagate it to
other humans.

1174
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
other humans.

1175
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,430
other humans.
&gt;&gt; Well, there there is no difference. The

1176
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
&gt;&gt; Well, there there is no difference. The

1177
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,190
&gt;&gt; Well, there there is no difference. The
people are people.

1178
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200


1179
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,390
&gt;&gt; Uh what do you mean by a person?

1180
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
&gt;&gt; Uh what do you mean by a person?

1181
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,909
&gt;&gt; Uh what do you mean by a person?
&gt;&gt; It's somebody who is capable of

1182
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
&gt;&gt; It's somebody who is capable of

1183
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,390
&gt;&gt; It's somebody who is capable of
explanatory creativity.

1184
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
explanatory creativity.

1185
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,390
explanatory creativity.
&gt;&gt; And why does that the thing we're

1186
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
&gt;&gt; And why does that the thing we're

1187
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,830
&gt;&gt; And why does that the thing we're
talking about? The thing that causes the

1188
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
talking about? The thing that causes the

1189
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,870
talking about? The thing that causes the
G in AGI. Yes. Um I mean you could be

1190
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
G in AGI. Yes. Um I mean you could be

1191
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,470
G in AGI. Yes. Um I mean you could be
capable of coming up with creative

1192
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
capable of coming up with creative

1193
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,549
capable of coming up with creative
explanations about some things but not

1194
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
explanations about some things but not

1195
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,590
explanations about some things but not
others.

1196
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
others.

1197
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,269
others.
&gt;&gt; I think not because the the method of

1198
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
&gt;&gt; I think not because the the method of

1199
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,750
&gt;&gt; I think not because the the method of
creating creative explanations is

1200
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
creating creative explanations is

1201
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,230
creating creative explanations is
independent of the subject.

1202
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
independent of the subject.

1203
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,669
independent of the subject.
Um it it's I mean you know there wasn't

1204
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
Um it it's I mean you know there wasn't

1205
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,950
Um it it's I mean you know there wasn't
a module for general relativity waiting

1206
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
a module for general relativity waiting

1207
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,269
a module for general relativity waiting
30,000 years or 300,000 years [laughter]

1208
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
30,000 years or 300,000 years [laughter]

1209
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,269
30,000 years or 300,000 years [laughter]
for Einstein to come along and finally

1210
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
for Einstein to come along and finally

1211
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,350
for Einstein to come along and finally
use that module. He used the same kind

1212
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
use that module. He used the same kind

1213
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,110
use that module. He used the same kind
of thinking as our ancestors used to to

1214
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
of thinking as our ancestors used to to

1215
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,750
of thinking as our ancestors used to to
build the first campfire.

1216
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:45,760
build the first campfire.

1217
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,390
build the first campfire.
&gt;&gt; Sure. I mean in morality there is kind

1218
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:48,400
&gt;&gt; Sure. I mean in morality there is kind

1219
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,269
&gt;&gt; Sure. I mean in morality there is kind
of an inbuilt module which is our own

1220
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
of an inbuilt module which is our own

1221
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,470
of an inbuilt module which is our own
qualia, our own sensory experiences of

1222
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
qualia, our own sensory experiences of

1223
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,710
qualia, our own sensory experiences of
of what's fun and what's not, what's

1224
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
of what's fun and what's not, what's

1225
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,389
of what's fun and what's not, what's
enjoyable and what's what counts as

1226
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
enjoyable and what's what counts as

1227
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,950
enjoyable and what's what counts as
suffering. And it's possible that AIs

1228
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
suffering. And it's possible that AIs

1229
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,990
suffering. And it's possible that AIs
wouldn't share that same bedrock, that

1230
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
wouldn't share that same bedrock, that

1231
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,950
wouldn't share that same bedrock, that
same module.

1232
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960
same module.

1233
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,870
same module.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it's not bedrock. And it's the

1234
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it's not bedrock. And it's the

1235
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,870
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it's not bedrock. And it's the
same issue because um different people

1236
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
same issue because um different people

1237
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,669
same issue because um different people
greatly differ on what counts as

1238
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
greatly differ on what counts as

1239
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,990
greatly differ on what counts as
qualia that they want to aim for and

1240
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,000
qualia that they want to aim for and

1241
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,389
qualia that they want to aim for and
qualia that they do not want to aim for.

1242
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
qualia that they do not want to aim for.

1243
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,149
qualia that they do not want to aim for.
So um I I'm sitting in Oxford here uh

1244
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,159
So um I I'm sitting in Oxford here uh

1245
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,070
So um I I'm sitting in Oxford here uh
not very far from here. Archbishop

1246
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
not very far from here. Archbishop

1247
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,750
not very far from here. Archbishop
Cranmer stuck his hand in the fire uh

1248
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
Cranmer stuck his hand in the fire uh

1249
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,590
Cranmer stuck his hand in the fire uh
because it was the hand that signed

1250
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
because it was the hand that signed

1251
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,990
because it was the hand that signed
whatever it was that that he now

1252
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
whatever it was that that he now

1253
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,510
whatever it was that that he now
regretted and he was going to be burnt

1254
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
regretted and he was going to be burnt

1255
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,549
regretted and he was going to be burnt
at the stake and so on and and so he

1256
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
at the stake and so on and and so he

1257
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,830
at the stake and so on and and so he
stuck his hand in the fire. I I uh

1258
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
stuck his hand in the fire. I I uh

1259
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,470
stuck his hand in the fire. I I uh
apparently that's historically uh rock

1260
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
apparently that's historically uh rock

1261
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,269
apparently that's historically uh rock
solid. He really did do it and there are

1262
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
solid. He really did do it and there are

1263
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,519
solid. He really did do it and there are
people who set fire to themselves. Um

1264
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:50,529
people who set fire to themselves. Um

1265
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,990
people who set fire to themselves. Um
[snorts] so and there are people who

1266
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
[snorts] so and there are people who

1267
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,070
[snorts] so and there are people who
starve themselves to death. Um so or

1268
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
starve themselves to death. Um so or

1269
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,830
starve themselves to death. Um so or
drown themselves. Uh so we are

1270
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
drown themselves. Uh so we are

1271
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,630
drown themselves. Uh so we are
one of the things that has evolved

1272
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
one of the things that has evolved

1273
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,990
one of the things that has evolved
between when we were

1274
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
between when we were

1275
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,310
between when we were
just AIS or you know apes and when our

1276
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
just AIS or you know apes and when our

1277
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,590
just AIS or you know apes and when our
ape ancestors became people.

1278
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
ape ancestors became people.

1279
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,510
ape ancestors became people.
uh is the ability to to disregard the

1280
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
uh is the ability to to disregard the

1281
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,389
uh is the ability to to disregard the
the criteria

1282
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
the criteria

1283
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,750
the criteria
um inherited by through genes from our

1284
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:25,760
um inherited by through genes from our

1285
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,110
um inherited by through genes from our
ancestors.

1286
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
ancestors.

1287
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,389
ancestors.
&gt;&gt; So we we inherited uh an aversion to

1288
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
&gt;&gt; So we we inherited uh an aversion to

1289
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,430
&gt;&gt; So we we inherited uh an aversion to
fire. Uh we couldn't have made uh

1290
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
fire. Uh we couldn't have made uh

1291
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,230
fire. Uh we couldn't have made uh
campfires if we hadn't been able to over

1292
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
campfires if we hadn't been able to over

1293
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,630
campfires if we hadn't been able to over
override that not override is the wrong

1294
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
override that not override is the wrong

1295
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,310
override that not override is the wrong
word. set aside that aversion in favor

1296
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
word. set aside that aversion in favor

1297
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,750
word. set aside that aversion in favor
of curiosity and hope and and problem

1298
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
of curiosity and hope and and problem

1299
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,590
of curiosity and hope and and problem
solving and all the things that were

1300
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
solving and all the things that were

1301
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,389
solving and all the things that were
important to our ancestors. They were

1302
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
important to our ancestors. They were

1303
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,750
important to our ancestors. They were
able to set that aside. Uh so to set

1304
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
able to set that aside. Uh so to set

1305
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,630
able to set that aside. Uh so to set
their sorry to set their um aversion to

1306
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
their sorry to set their um aversion to

1307
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,350
their sorry to set their um aversion to
fire aside.

1308
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
fire aside.

1309
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,549
fire aside.
Um so uh the the um

1310
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
Um so uh the the um

1311
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,470
Um so uh the the um

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,669

they they are raw material for our

00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:15,679
they they are raw material for our

1321
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,389

1322
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
raw material. Maybe that's one of the

1323
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,149
raw material. Maybe that's one of the
things that's needed for AGI. We don't

1324
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:22,159
things that's needed for AGI. We don't

1325
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,870
things that's needed for AGI. We don't
know. Maybe they they they could only be

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
know. Maybe they they they could only be

robots with artificial senses and

1329
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,510
robots with artificial senses and
artificial pain and so on. But uh that's

1330
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:31,520
artificial pain and so on. But uh that's

1331
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,830
artificial pain and so on. But uh that's
not going to determine whether they are

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
not going to determine whether they are

1333
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,990
not going to determine whether they are
good or bad people. Whether they are

1334
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
good or bad people. Whether they are

1335
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,430
good or bad people. Whether they are
good or bad people is going to be

good or bad people is going to be

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,389
good or bad people is going to be

&gt;&gt; I think it's maybe worth distinguishing

1344
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
&gt;&gt; I think it's maybe worth distinguishing

1345
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,350
&gt;&gt; I think it's maybe worth distinguishing
the idea of good and bad versus simply

1346
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
the idea of good and bad versus simply

1347
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,669
the idea of good and bad versus simply
different values. I think it's possible

1348
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
different values. I think it's possible

1349
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,430
different values. I think it's possible
that I mean suppose we had um alien

1350
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
that I mean suppose we had um alien

1351
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,789
that I mean suppose we had um alien
contact and the aliens could be

1352
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
contact and the aliens could be

1353
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,710
contact and the aliens could be
perfectly nice people to each other. Uh

1354
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
perfectly nice people to each other. Uh

1355
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,230
perfectly nice people to each other. Uh
except they just have very very

1356
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
except they just have very very

1357
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,070
except they just have very very
different values to us. Um and it's not

1358
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
different values to us. Um and it's not

1359
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,310
different values to us. Um and it's not
therefore they would be dangerous to us

1360
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
therefore they would be dangerous to us

1361
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,310
therefore they would be dangerous to us
and we would be dangerous to them. Not

1362
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
and we would be dangerous to them. Not

1363
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,990
and we would be dangerous to them. Not
because either of us are more evil than

1364
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
because either of us are more evil than

1365
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,669
because either of us are more evil than
the other, just because we have

1366
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
the other, just because we have

1367
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,470
the other, just because we have
different values, different desires for

1368
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,480
different values, different desires for

1369
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,669
different values, different desires for
what to do with uh well, what's around

1370
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
what to do with uh well, what's around

1371
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,110
what to do with uh well, what's around
us, how to steer the future, and that

1372
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
us, how to steer the future, and that

1373
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,350
us, how to steer the future, and that
alone would put us into conflict without

1374
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
alone would put us into conflict without

1375
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,110
alone would put us into conflict without
saying that anyone is fundamentally

1376
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
saying that anyone is fundamentally

1377
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,070
saying that anyone is fundamentally
worse than the other. Well, uh I I think

1378
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
worse than the other. Well, uh I I think

1379
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,070
worse than the other. Well, uh I I think
that if we do encounter aliens in that

1380
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
that if we do encounter aliens in that

1381
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,190
that if we do encounter aliens in that
way, which I think is very unlikely

1382
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
way, which I think is very unlikely

1383
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,070
way, which I think is very unlikely
given the distances involved, but if if

1384
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
given the distances involved, but if if

1385
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,470
given the distances involved, but if if
we do, I think it's very much on the

1386
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
we do, I think it's very much on the

1387
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,669
we do, I think it's very much on the
cards that we will have different

1388
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
cards that we will have different

1389
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,110
cards that we will have different
values,

1390
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
values,

1391
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,830
values,
&gt;&gt; but it's uh inconceivable to me that the

1392
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
&gt;&gt; but it's uh inconceivable to me that the

1393
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,430
&gt;&gt; but it's uh inconceivable to me that the
that

1394
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
that

1395
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,950
that
that

1396
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
that

1397
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,750
that
we couldn't resolve this the same way

1398
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
we couldn't resolve this the same way

1399
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,669
we couldn't resolve this the same way
that we attained our present values,

1400
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
that we attained our present values,

1401
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,509
that we attained our present values,
which are extremely different from what

1402
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,519
which are extremely different from what

1403
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,909
which are extremely different from what
our values were a thousand years ago and

1404
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
our values were a thousand years ago and

1405
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,750
our values were a thousand years ago and
that was different from what they were

1406
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
that was different from what they were

1407
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,789
that was different from what they were
10,000 years ago. Uh they will they

1408
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799
10,000 years ago. Uh they will they

1409
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,630
10,000 years ago. Uh they will they
would probably be a million millions of

1410
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
would probably be a million millions of

1411
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,669
would probably be a million millions of
years ahead of us and presumably more

1412
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
years ahead of us and presumably more

1413
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,149
years ahead of us and presumably more
moral than us. I I would think one of

1414
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
moral than us. I I would think one of

1415
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,630
moral than us. I I would think one of
the things that happens with the growth

1416
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
the things that happens with the growth

1417
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,789
the things that happens with the growth
of knowledge is that um uh solving

1418
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
of knowledge is that um uh solving

1419
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,710
of knowledge is that um uh solving
problems sometimes causes a jump to

1420
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
problems sometimes causes a jump to

1421
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,630
problems sometimes causes a jump to
universality.

1422
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
universality.

1423
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,750
universality.
So uh we and this happened in regard to

1424
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
So uh we and this happened in regard to

1425
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,310
So uh we and this happened in regard to
morality in our early prehistory when

1426
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
morality in our early prehistory when

1427
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,950
morality in our early prehistory when
people started uh thinking not just

1428
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
people started uh thinking not just

1429
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,669
people started uh thinking not just
what's good for my tribe but what is

1430
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
what's good for my tribe but what is

1431
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,389
what's good for my tribe but what is
actually good. There's the the ethifro

1432
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
actually good. There's the the ethifro

1433
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,509
actually good. There's the the ethifro
dialogue of Plato where where he says

1434
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
dialogue of Plato where where he says

1435
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,310
dialogue of Plato where where he says
are the are the gods um do the gods want

1436
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
are the are the gods um do the gods want

1437
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,269
are the are the gods um do the gods want
to do good because

1438
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
to do good because

1439
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,830
to do good because
um that's what good is. it's what the

1440
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
um that's what good is. it's what the

1441
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,590
um that's what good is. it's what the
gods want or is it because there's

1442
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
gods want or is it because there's

1443
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,190
gods want or is it because there's
something other than the gods that

1444
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
something other than the gods that

1445
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,350
something other than the gods that
something objective

1446
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
something objective

1447
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,190
something objective
where it's meaningful to say and it's

1448
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
where it's meaningful to say and it's

1449
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,430
where it's meaningful to say and it's
it's also in the uh it's in the Hebrew

00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
it's also in the uh it's in the Hebrew

1451
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,070
it's also in the uh it's in the Hebrew

gives us morality not subject to

00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
gives us morality not subject to

1459
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,230
gives us morality not subject to
morality some something like that. So

1460
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,240
morality some something like that. So

1461
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,909
morality some something like that. So
&gt;&gt; they're already thinking that and the

1462
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
&gt;&gt; they're already thinking that and the

1463
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,430
&gt;&gt; they're already thinking that and the
fact that they're thinking that shows

1464
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,440
fact that they're thinking that shows

1465
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,750
fact that they're thinking that shows
that some previous time people weren't

1466
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
that some previous time people weren't

1467
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,149
that some previous time people weren't
thinking about that. They they they were

1468
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
thinking about that. They they they were

1469
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,590
thinking about that. They they they were
thinking in a much more narrow way and

1470
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,600
thinking in a much more narrow way and

1471
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,710
thinking in a much more narrow way and
to get to the objective morality idea.

1472
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
to get to the objective morality idea.

1473
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,710
to get to the objective morality idea.
They got to it by trying to improve

1474
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
They got to it by trying to improve

1475
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,430
They got to it by trying to improve
their values or or rather by trying to

1476
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
their values or or rather by trying to

1477
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,990
their values or or rather by trying to
solve their problems by improving their

1478
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000
solve their problems by improving their

1479
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,750
solve their problems by improving their
values.

1480
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
values.

1481
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,470
values.
So, so that's what they did and that

1482
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
So, so that's what they did and that

1483
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,070
So, so that's what they did and that
that's what you know if we were several

1484
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
that's what you know if we were several

1485
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,310
that's what you know if we were several
million years apart or whatever we would

1486
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
million years apart or whatever we would

1487
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,870
million years apart or whatever we would
have to do that in spades with the with

1488
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:00,880
have to do that in spades with the with

1489
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,990
have to do that in spades with the with
the aliens [laughter]

1490
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
the aliens [laughter]

1491
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,269
the aliens [laughter]
that's again that's good

1492
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
that's again that's good

1493
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,470
that's again that's good
&gt;&gt; um I suppose there's one question of

1494
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
&gt;&gt; um I suppose there's one question of

1495
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,589
&gt;&gt; um I suppose there's one question of
would we talk it out uh it's it's

1496
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
would we talk it out uh it's it's

1497
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,550
would we talk it out uh it's it's
possible that they just wouldn't be

1498
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
possible that they just wouldn't be

1499
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,710
possible that they just wouldn't be
bothered to talk it out uh I mean

1500
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:18,720
bothered to talk it out uh I mean

1501
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,389
bothered to talk it out uh I mean
historically

1502
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399
historically

1503
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,109
historically
some Human cultures have not always been

1504
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
some Human cultures have not always been

1505
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,790
some Human cultures have not always been
motivated to talk it out with other

1506
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
motivated to talk it out with other

1507
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,710
motivated to talk it out with other
cultures. They've just colonized and

1508
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
cultures. They've just colonized and

1509
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,069
cultures. They've just colonized and
suppressed.

1510
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
suppressed.

1511
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,909
suppressed.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it does happen, but it it

1512
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it does happen, but it it

1513
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it does happen, but it it
happens less often than than you're

1514
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
happens less often than than you're

1515
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,950
happens less often than than you're
making out. Um, you know, Genghis Khan

1516
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
making out. Um, you know, Genghis Khan

1517
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,669
making out. Um, you know, Genghis Khan
may be may be an example of someone who

1518
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
may be may be an example of someone who

1519
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,389
may be may be an example of someone who
just conquered. But people like the

1520
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
just conquered. But people like the

1521
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,710
just conquered. But people like the
Romans, the Romans always wanted an

1522
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
Romans, the Romans always wanted an

1523
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,230
Romans, the Romans always wanted an
excuse for when to invade someone.

1524
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
excuse for when to invade someone.

1525
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,310
excuse for when to invade someone.
So, so the fact that they wanted an

1526
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
So, so the fact that they wanted an

1527
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,629
So, so the fact that they wanted an
excuse means that they they um had an

1528
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
excuse means that they they um had an

1529
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,349
excuse means that they they um had an
idea that that um they wanted to think

1530
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
idea that that um they wanted to think

1531
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,349
idea that that um they wanted to think
of themselves as people who act morally

1532
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
of themselves as people who act morally

1533
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,430
of themselves as people who act morally
according to a code. And uh there's the

1534
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
according to a code. And uh there's the

1535
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,310
according to a code. And uh there's the
before that there's the Athenians in the

1536
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
before that there's the Athenians in the

1537
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,230
before that there's the Athenians in the
Pelipenian war who conquered this island

1538
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,240
Pelipenian war who conquered this island

1539
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,470
Pelipenian war who conquered this island
um Milos or something. The Melian

1540
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
um Milos or something. The Melian

1541
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,630
um Milos or something. The Melian
dialogue is is when um uh they are

1542
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
dialogue is is when um uh they are

1543
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,550
dialogue is is when um uh they are
reputed to have said um uh the strong do

1544
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
reputed to have said um uh the strong do

1545
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,030
reputed to have said um uh the strong do
what they can and the weak endure what

1546
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
what they can and the weak endure what

1547
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,790
what they can and the weak endure what
they must. M

1548
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
they must. M

1549
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,670
they must. M
&gt;&gt; and [clears throat]

1550
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:27,680
&gt;&gt; and [clears throat]

1551
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,750
&gt;&gt; and [clears throat]
but you see they had to say that that

1552
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
but you see they had to say that that

1553
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,109
but you see they had to say that that
that was a pathetic justification

1554
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
that was a pathetic justification

1555
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,670
that was a pathetic justification
of what they wanted to do despite the

1556
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
of what they wanted to do despite the

1557
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,190
of what they wanted to do despite the
fact that they knew there were moral

1558
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
fact that they knew there were moral

1559
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,109
fact that they knew there were moral
arguments against it. Maybe they thought

1560
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:41,119
arguments against it. Maybe they thought

1561
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,030
arguments against it. Maybe they thought
that there were other moral arguments in

1562
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
that there were other moral arguments in

1563
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,349
that there were other moral arguments in
favor of it in that situation. But even

1564
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
favor of it in that situation. But even

1565
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,230
favor of it in that situation. But even
in those days when it was quite normal

1566
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,240
in those days when it was quite normal

1567
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,470
in those days when it was quite normal
to to if if a place didn't

1568
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
to to if if a place didn't

1569
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,430
to to if if a place didn't
um uh surrender, if a city didn't

1570
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
um uh surrender, if a city didn't

1571
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,510
um uh surrender, if a city didn't
surrender, then then when you later

1572
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
surrender, then then when you later

1573
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,510
surrender, then then when you later
conquered it, you would kill all the men

1574
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
conquered it, you would kill all the men

1575
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,109
conquered it, you would kill all the men
and take the women and children into

1576
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
and take the women and children into

1577
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,510
and take the women and children into
slavery. That was normal, but it wasn't

1578
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:03,520
slavery. That was normal, but it wasn't

1579
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,150
slavery. That was normal, but it wasn't
universal even then.

1580
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
universal even then.

1581
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,470
universal even then.
So, um people thought about what was

1582
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
So, um people thought about what was

1583
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,030
So, um people thought about what was
better. And while they were thinking not

1584
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
better. And while they were thinking not

1585
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,790
better. And while they were thinking not
very good ideas about what was better,

1586
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:14,800
very good ideas about what was better,

1587
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,349
very good ideas about what was better,
they didn't make so much progress. They

1588
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
they didn't make so much progress. They

1589
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,230
they didn't make so much progress. They
started making very rapid progress at a

1590
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
started making very rapid progress at a

1591
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,710
started making very rapid progress at a
time when they allowed

1592
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:22,720
time when they allowed

1593
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,349
time when they allowed
their moral theories to be subject to

1594
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:25,359
their moral theories to be subject to

1595
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,150
their moral theories to be subject to
the same error correction type process

1596
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
the same error correction type process

1597
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,030
the same error correction type process
as as their scientific theories and and

1598
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
as as their scientific theories and and

1599
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,710
as as their scientific theories and and
their astronomical theories and all

1600
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
their astronomical theories and all

1601
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,109
their astronomical theories and all
their other theories.

1602
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
their other theories.

1603
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,670
their other theories.
And and it's not it's not an accident

1604
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
And and it's not it's not an accident

1605
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,510
And and it's not it's not an accident
that they came to converge.

1606
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
that they came to converge.

1607
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,829
that they came to converge.
um different moral theories came to

1608
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
um different moral theories came to

1609
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,790
um different moral theories came to
converge.

1610
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
converge.

1611
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,230
converge.
&gt;&gt; The the the different polities

within the uh enlightenment countries
within the west came came to converge

00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,560
within the west came came to converge

1617
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,069
within the west came came to converge
slowly.

1618
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079
slowly.

1619
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,069
slowly.
They did have wars but they had fewer

1620
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
They did have wars but they had fewer

1621
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,230
They did have wars but they had fewer
and fewer wars and now they're having no

1622
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
and fewer wars and now they're having no

1623
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,030
and fewer wars and now they're having no
wars among themselves.

1624
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
wars among themselves.

1625
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,950
wars among themselves.
they could converge because through

1626
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:06,960
they could converge because through

1627
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,550
they could converge because through
an exploration of what they think is

1628
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,560
an exploration of what they think is

1629
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,910
an exploration of what they think is
morally true leads to them to what is

1630
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
morally true leads to them to what is

1631
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,069
morally true leads to them to what is
objectively morally true that that there

1632
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
objectively morally true that that there

1633
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,670
objectively morally true that that there
are actual errors that they actually

1634
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
are actual errors that they actually

1635
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,990
are actual errors that they actually
eliminate. But it could also be the case

1636
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
eliminate. But it could also be the case

1637
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,950
eliminate. But it could also be the case
that uh societies that um

1638
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
that uh societies that um

1639
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,430
that uh societies that um
manage to construct moral theories true

1640
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
manage to construct moral theories true

1641
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,030
manage to construct moral theories true
or not that allow them to cooperate uh

1642
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
or not that allow them to cooperate uh

1643
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,270
or not that allow them to cooperate uh
are more successful. So, it could it

1644
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
are more successful. So, it could it

1645
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,829
are more successful. So, it could it
could be the case that how do I want to

1646
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839
could be the case that how do I want to

1647
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,870
could be the case that how do I want to
say this? I I I could well believe that

1648
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:36,880
say this? I I I could well believe that

1649
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,670
say this? I I I could well believe that
this this alien civilization could

1650
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
this this alien civilization could

1651
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,190
this this alien civilization could
engage in moral dialogue with us and yet

1652
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
engage in moral dialogue with us and yet

1653
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,190
engage in moral dialogue with us and yet
simply come to different conclusions

1654
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200
simply come to different conclusions

1655
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,910
simply come to different conclusions
because there's no objective moral truth

1656
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
because there's no objective moral truth

1657
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,710
because there's no objective moral truth
that's sort of pushing us both towards

1658
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
that's sort of pushing us both towards

1659
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,470
that's sort of pushing us both towards
the same thing.

1660
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480


1661
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,761
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, it's pulling

1662
00:37:58,761 --> 00:37:58,771


1663
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:00,870
[laughter] because we're looking for it.

1664
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
[laughter] because we're looking for it.

1665
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,430
[laughter] because we're looking for it.
So, one of one of the things you can do

1666
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
So, one of one of the things you can do

1667
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,030
So, one of one of the things you can do
when solving a a problem, you you can

1668
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
when solving a a problem, you you can

1669
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,630
when solving a a problem, you you can
you can narrow the problem and say,

1670
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
you can narrow the problem and say,

1671
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,069
you can narrow the problem and say,
well, can I solve this for the moment

1672
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:10,079
well, can I solve this for the moment

1673
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,069
well, can I solve this for the moment
and never mind the general case? Or you

1674
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:12,079
and never mind the general case? Or you

1675
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,430
and never mind the general case? Or you
can say, what would the general case

1676
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
can say, what would the general case

1677
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,230
can say, what would the general case
look like? How does how does can can we

1678
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,240
look like? How does how does can can we

1679
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,349
look like? How does how does can can we
can we import a problem from somewhere

1680
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:19,359
can we import a problem from somewhere

1681
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,470
can we import a problem from somewhere
else and apply it to this case? And when

1682
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
else and apply it to this case? And when

1683
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,670
else and apply it to this case? And when
when we do then we naturally wonder is

1684
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
when we do then we naturally wonder is

1685
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,190
when we do then we naturally wonder is
there something in common between these

1686
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
there something in common between these

1687
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,069
there something in common between these
two cases. And so people say the same

1688
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:32,079
two cases. And so people say the same

1689
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,069
two cases. And so people say the same
thing about laws of physics. You know

1690
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
thing about laws of physics. You know

1691
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,990
thing about laws of physics. You know
may maybe maybe

1692
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
may maybe maybe

1693
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,550
may maybe maybe
the the aliens have have the physics

1694
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
the the aliens have have the physics

1695
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,630
the the aliens have have the physics
which is completely different from ours.

1696
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
which is completely different from ours.

1697
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,430
which is completely different from ours.
So that for them they can travel faster

1698
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
So that for them they can travel faster

1699
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,109
So that for them they can travel faster
than light because uh they they conceive

1700
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
than light because uh they they conceive

1701
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,430
than light because uh they they conceive
of the world in such a different way

1702
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
of the world in such a different way

1703
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,190
of the world in such a different way
that they can build machines that can

1704
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
that they can build machines that can

1705
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,950
that they can build machines that can
travel faster than light and they never

1706
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:54,960
travel faster than light and they never

1707
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,589
travel faster than light and they never
they kind of went round our problem with

1708
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
they kind of went round our problem with

1709
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,310
they kind of went round our problem with
a finite speed of light and arrived

1710
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
a finite speed of light and arrived

1711
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,349
a finite speed of light and arrived
somewhere else um where we haven't got

1712
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359
somewhere else um where we haven't got

1713
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,069
somewhere else um where we haven't got
to or or now I I think that's that's um

1714
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:08,079
to or or now I I think that's that's um

1715
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,310
to or or now I I think that's that's um
that requires a kind of conspiracy in

1716
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,320
that requires a kind of conspiracy in

1717
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,390
that requires a kind of conspiracy in
the laws of nature.

1718
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
the laws of nature.

1719
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,750
the laws of nature.
uh for there to be two solutions to

1720
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
uh for there to be two solutions to

1721
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,030
uh for there to be two solutions to
&gt;&gt; things like how does light behave uh

1722
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
&gt;&gt; things like how does light behave uh

1723
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,750
&gt;&gt; things like how does light behave uh
which are not visible to each other. And

1724
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
which are not visible to each other. And

1725
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,750
which are not visible to each other. And
with morality

1726
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
with morality

1727
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,470
with morality
it is much more so because with moral

1728
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,480
it is much more so because with moral

1729
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,190
it is much more so because with moral
with the with physics it's just a with

1730
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
with the with physics it's just a with

1731
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,109
with the with physics it's just a with
with fundamental physics anyway it's

1732
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
with fundamental physics anyway it's

1733
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,349
with fundamental physics anyway it's
just a question of how can we understand

1734
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
just a question of how can we understand

1735
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,950
just a question of how can we understand
the world being one way or rather than

1736
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
the world being one way or rather than

1737
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,589
the world being one way or rather than
another way. But with morality, it's how

1738
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599
another way. But with morality, it's how

1739
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,670
another way. But with morality, it's how
can we do things such that we align with

1740
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
can we do things such that we align with

1741
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,670
can we do things such that we align with
other people who are doing things and so

1742
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
other people who are doing things and so

1743
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,950
other people who are doing things and so
on. So the idea that our morality should

1744
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
on. So the idea that our morality should

1745
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,230
on. So the idea that our morality should
be compatible with with the thought what

1746
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,240
be compatible with with the thought what

1747
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,829
be compatible with with the thought what
would I do if I was them

1748
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
would I do if I was them

1749
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,829
would I do if I was them
um it's it's become second nature to us.

1750
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
um it's it's become second nature to us.

1751
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,829
um it's it's become second nature to us.
It must become second nature to anyone

1752
00:39:59,829 --> 00:39:59,839
It must become second nature to anyone

1753
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,349
It must become second nature to anyone
else who's been doing this especially

1754
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
else who's been doing this especially

1755
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,349
else who's been doing this especially
for a million years.

1756
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
for a million years.

1757
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,270
for a million years.
Let let me ask a couple more questions

1758
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
Let let me ask a couple more questions

1759
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,349
Let let me ask a couple more questions
to see if I can get this idea in my head

1760
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:07,359
to see if I can get this idea in my head

1761
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,670
to see if I can get this idea in my head
in my head. Um, when we're when we're

1762
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:11,680
in my head. Um, when we're when we're

1763
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,910
in my head. Um, when we're when we're
thinking about scientific theories and

1764
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:13,920
thinking about scientific theories and

1765
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,550
thinking about scientific theories and
trying to understand the world, the

1766
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,560
trying to understand the world, the

1767
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,190
trying to understand the world, the
world gets to bite back and chop off

1768
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
world gets to bite back and chop off

1769
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,630
world gets to bite back and chop off
some of our bad hypotheses. Uh, for you

1770
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
some of our bad hypotheses. Uh, for you

1771
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,150
some of our bad hypotheses. Uh, for you
you come up with some scientific theory,

1772
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
you come up with some scientific theory,

1773
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,950
you come up with some scientific theory,
it makes a prediction, you test it, and

1774
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:26,960
it makes a prediction, you test it, and

1775
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,630
it makes a prediction, you test it, and
you don't get the predictions you you

1776
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:28,640
you don't get the predictions you you

1777
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,990
you don't get the predictions you you
thought you would, and therefore that

1778
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,000
thought you would, and therefore that

1779
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,790
thought you would, and therefore that
theory is gone. It's eliminated. What's

1780
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
theory is gone. It's eliminated. What's

1781
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,510
theory is gone. It's eliminated. What's
the equivalent in morality where reality

1782
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:35,520
the equivalent in morality where reality

1783
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,069
the equivalent in morality where reality
bites back and shaves off uh your bad

1784
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079
bites back and shaves off uh your bad

1785
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,270
bites back and shaves off uh your bad
hypothesis?

1786
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,280
hypothesis?

1787
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,230
hypothesis?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, there is there is exactly

1788
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, there is there is exactly

1789
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,150
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, there is there is exactly
the same phenomenon in morality, but

1790
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
the same phenomenon in morality, but

1791
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,990
the same phenomenon in morality, but
with the morality, we've got more. So,

1792
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
with the morality, we've got more. So,

1793
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,950
with the morality, we've got more. So,
let me say where where it's the same is

1794
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
let me say where where it's the same is

1795
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,150
let me say where where it's the same is
if you've got a a rock star who um

1796
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
if you've got a a rock star who um

1797
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,069
if you've got a a rock star who um
starts earning millions of pounds and uh

1798
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
starts earning millions of pounds and uh

1799
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,630
starts earning millions of pounds and uh
starts being able to indulge his wildest

1800
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
starts being able to indulge his wildest

1801
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,950
starts being able to indulge his wildest
dreams and to have groupies on tap uh

1802
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
dreams and to have groupies on tap uh

1803
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,589
dreams and to have groupies on tap uh
every day and and finds that he's

1804
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:07,599
every day and and finds that he's

1805
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,950
every day and and finds that he's
getting less and less happy.

1806
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:10,960
getting less and less happy.

1807
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,589
getting less and less happy.
&gt;&gt; Uh he's got a moral problem. It's not

1808
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
&gt;&gt; Uh he's got a moral problem. It's not

1809
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,950
&gt;&gt; Uh he's got a moral problem. It's not
that he's failing to uh stimulate the

1810
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:16,960
that he's failing to uh stimulate the

1811
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,510
that he's failing to uh stimulate the
the same hormones

1812
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
the same hormones

1813
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,510
the same hormones
uh or something that that would have

1814
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
uh or something that that would have

1815
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,990
uh or something that that would have
been there when when he was poor. It's

1816
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
been there when when he was poor. It's

1817
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,230
been there when when he was poor. It's
that he realizes that he didn't act what

1818
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,240
that he realizes that he didn't act what

1819
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,950
that he realizes that he didn't act what
he actually wanted was not to increase

1820
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
he actually wanted was not to increase

1821
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,710
he actually wanted was not to increase
the level of those hormones. It was

1822
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
the level of those hormones. It was

1823
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,950
the level of those hormones. It was
something else which he has to

1824
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
something else which he has to

1825
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,710
something else which he has to
creatively think, creatively

1826
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:36,720
creatively think, creatively

1827
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,230
creatively think, creatively
um

1828
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,240
um

1829
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,030
um
um construct

1830
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,040
um construct

1831
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,430
um construct
so as to

1832
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,440
so as to

1833
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,349
so as to
be better

1834
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:45,359
be better

1835
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,990
be better
be better in a way that was not defined

1836
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
be better in a way that was not defined

1837
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,550
be better in a way that was not defined
by his previous self.

1838
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
by his previous self.

1839
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,910
by his previous self.
And that that uh so that's a moral

1840
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
And that that uh so that's a moral

1841
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,069
And that that uh so that's a moral
problem. And if he fails to solve it

1842
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
problem. And if he fails to solve it

1843
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,190
problem. And if he fails to solve it
then he will run into practical

1844
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
then he will run into practical

1845
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,430
then he will run into practical
u problems as well. But the you know as

1846
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
u problems as well. But the you know as

1847
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,670
u problems as well. But the you know as
I said the the practical thing is is is

1848
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
I said the the practical thing is is is

1849
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,230
I said the the practical thing is is is
more immediate with with the morality

1850
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
more immediate with with the morality

1851
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,790
more immediate with with the morality
than it is with physics. You you can go

1852
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:14,800
than it is with physics. You you can go

1853
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,710
than it is with physics. You you can go
along believing the Copenhagen

1854
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
along believing the Copenhagen

1855
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,349
along believing the Copenhagen
interpretation for decades and nothing

1856
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
interpretation for decades and nothing

1857
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,109
interpretation for decades and nothing
will happen to you.

1858
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
will happen to you.

1859
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,470
will happen to you.
&gt;&gt; Right?

1860
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
&gt;&gt; Right?

1861
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,030
&gt;&gt; Right?
But but if you if you believe that that

1862
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,040
But but if you if you believe that that

1863
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,230
But but if you if you believe that that
u morality consists of pursuing physical

1864
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
u morality consists of pursuing physical

1865
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,270
u morality consists of pursuing physical
pleasure at everything else's expense

1866
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
pleasure at everything else's expense

1867
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,870
pleasure at everything else's expense
then you will find out much faster.

1868
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
then you will find out much faster.

1869
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,390
then you will find out much faster.
Um so now there's also the theoretical

1870
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
Um so now there's also the theoretical

1871
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,550
Um so now there's also the theoretical
side of of morality which again you

1872
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
side of of morality which again you

1873
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,550
side of of morality which again you
could call it meta morality. It's kind

1874
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,560
could call it meta morality. It's kind

1875
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,109
could call it meta morality. It's kind
of uh theories about how to improve

1876
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
of uh theories about how to improve

1877
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,670
of uh theories about how to improve
moral theories. We we have the same

1878
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,680
moral theories. We we have the same

1879
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,670
moral theories. We we have the same
thing in physics. The theories of how

1880
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
thing in physics. The theories of how

1881
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,710
thing in physics. The theories of how
the the idea of that everything should

1882
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
the the idea of that everything should

1883
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,870
the the idea of that everything should
come down to testing

1884
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880
come down to testing

1885
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,150
come down to testing
is quite new. It it's

1886
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
is quite new. It it's

1887
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,750
is quite new. It it's
no older than Galileo and in some sense

1888
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
no older than Galileo and in some sense

1889
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,309
no older than Galileo and in some sense
no older than papa to make to make that

1890
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
no older than papa to make to make that

1891
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,990
no older than papa to make to make that
the prime uh principle. Um and uh the

1892
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
the prime uh principle. Um and uh the

1893
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,950
the prime uh principle. Um and uh the
like I said the idea of you know how

1894
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
like I said the idea of you know how

1895
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,309
like I said the idea of you know how
should I behave towards this other

1896
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
should I behave towards this other

1897
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,630
should I behave towards this other
person? Well um because my morality is

1898
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:26,640
person? Well um because my morality is

1899
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,870
person? Well um because my morality is
is conflicting with his morality. Well

1900
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
is conflicting with his morality. Well

1901
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,510
is conflicting with his morality. Well
what if I was him? What would I think

1902
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:31,520
what if I was him? What would I think

1903
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,190
what if I was him? What would I think
then?

1904
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
then?

1905
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,829
then?
Um should I want him to think like I'm

1906
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:35,839
Um should I want him to think like I'm

1907
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,190
Um should I want him to think like I'm
thinking now and so on. And that that's

1908
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
thinking now and so on. And that that's

1909
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,710
thinking now and so on. And that that's
like like a natural thing or at least it

1910
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
like like a natural thing or at least it

1911
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,950
like like a natural thing or at least it
seems natural to us now. Um maybe the

1912
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:44,960
seems natural to us now. Um maybe the

1913
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,230
seems natural to us now. Um maybe the
the golden rule uh had a had the

1914
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
the golden rule uh had a had the

1915
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,470
the golden rule uh had a had the
beginnings of that a couple of thousand

1916
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,480
beginnings of that a couple of thousand

1917
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,950
beginnings of that a couple of thousand
years ago but the golden rule was hailed

1918
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:52,960
years ago but the golden rule was hailed

1919
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,030
years ago but the golden rule was hailed
as something new at the time. So before

1920
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
as something new at the time. So before

1921
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,390
as something new at the time. So before
that they didn't have that. So the these

1922
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,400
that they didn't have that. So the these

1923
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,829
that they didn't have that. So the these
are theoretical advances in morality

1924
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:01,839
are theoretical advances in morality

1925
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,870
are theoretical advances in morality
um and and they can they can be made.

1926
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
um and and they can they can be made.

1927
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,550
um and and they can they can be made.
There's no there's never a guarantee

1928
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
There's no there's never a guarantee

1929
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,630
There's no there's never a guarantee
that we will find the right answer. So

1930
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
that we will find the right answer. So

1931
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,109
that we will find the right answer. So
it could be that we will be destroyed

1932
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
it could be that we will be destroyed

1933
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,870
it could be that we will be destroyed

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,230
where there's never a guarantee but nor
is there

1942
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
is there

1943
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,950
is there
doom on the horizon.

1944
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
doom on the horizon.

1945
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,390
doom on the horizon.
&gt;&gt; So let let me let me investigate both of

1946
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
&gt;&gt; So let let me let me investigate both of

1947
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,069
&gt;&gt; So let let me let me investigate both of
those points. So I think the first one

1948
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:32,079
those points. So I think the first one

1949
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,069
those points. So I think the first one
you said was the the way in which

1950
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
you said was the the way in which

1951
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,710
you said was the the way in which
reality can bite back on your false

1952
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
reality can bite back on your false

1953
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,069
reality can bite back on your false
moral theories or conjectures is if you

1954
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
moral theories or conjectures is if you

1955
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,710
moral theories or conjectures is if you
pursue a moral theory of how to live a

1956
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
pursue a moral theory of how to live a

1957
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,950
pursue a moral theory of how to live a
good life or how to treat other people

1958
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
good life or how to treat other people

1959
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,790
good life or how to treat other people
and at the end of that you find yourself

1960
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
and at the end of that you find yourself

1961
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,630
and at the end of that you find yourself
not actually very happy and not very

1962
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
not actually very happy and not very

1963
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,030
not actually very happy and not very
satisfied then that means that that

1964
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
satisfied then that means that that

1965
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,910
satisfied then that means that that
theory is going to get rejected by you.

1966
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
theory is going to get rejected by you.

1967
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,069
theory is going to get rejected by you.
&gt;&gt; Well uh it won't get rejected until you

1968
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
&gt;&gt; Well uh it won't get rejected until you

1969
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,430
&gt;&gt; Well uh it won't get rejected until you
have a better one.

1970
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
have a better one.

1971
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,430
have a better one.
&gt;&gt; Right. you you will you will have to

1972
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
&gt;&gt; Right. you you will you will have to

1973
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,150
&gt;&gt; Right. you you will you will have to
creatively either try to tinker with it

1974
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,160
creatively either try to tinker with it

1975
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,430
creatively either try to tinker with it
and improve it or go to another theory

1976
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
and improve it or go to another theory

1977
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,510
and improve it or go to another theory
or tinker with someone else's theory or

1978
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
or tinker with someone else's theory or

1979
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,390
or tinker with someone else's theory or
you know like get religion or whatever.

1980
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,400
you know like get religion or whatever.

1981
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,870
you know like get religion or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Uh

1982
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:10,880
&gt;&gt; Uh

1983
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,309
&gt;&gt; Uh
&gt;&gt; so if you

1984
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
&gt;&gt; so if you

1985
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,829
&gt;&gt; so if you
&gt;&gt; it it seems possible that you could have

1986
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
&gt;&gt; it it seems possible that you could have

1987
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,990
&gt;&gt; it it seems possible that you could have
that that reality won't bite back in the

1988
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000
that that reality won't bite back in the

1989
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,230
that that reality won't bite back in the
same way for different people. For some

1990
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,240
same way for different people. For some

1991
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,829
same way for different people. For some
people or agis or aliens pursuing a

1992
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
people or agis or aliens pursuing a

1993
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,670
people or agis or aliens pursuing a
moral theory will leave them happy and

1994
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
moral theory will leave them happy and

1995
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,109
moral theory will leave them happy and
satisfied. And for others such as AGIS,

1996
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
satisfied. And for others such as AGIS,

1997
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,510
satisfied. And for others such as AGIS,
it won't leave them happy or satisfied.

1998
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
it won't leave them happy or satisfied.

1999
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,750
it won't leave them happy or satisfied.
So why do we expect some convergence

2000
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
So why do we expect some convergence

2001
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,829
So why do we expect some convergence
there on on moral theories?

2002
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:35,839
there on on moral theories?

2003
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,270
there on on moral theories?
&gt;&gt; Well, because because none of us even

2004
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
&gt;&gt; Well, because because none of us even

2005
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,030
&gt;&gt; Well, because because none of us even
the rockstar

2006
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,040
the rockstar

2007
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,589
the rockstar
are actually driven by their qualia or

2008
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
are actually driven by their qualia or

2009
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,190
are actually driven by their qualia or
by [clears throat] their hormones or by

2010
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:47,200
by [clears throat] their hormones or by

2011
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,870
by [clears throat] their hormones or by
their DNA.

2012
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
their DNA.

2013
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,910
their DNA.
&gt;&gt; They they are always driven by trying to

2014
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
&gt;&gt; They they are always driven by trying to

2015
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,670
&gt;&gt; They they are always driven by trying to
solve problems. That that's what people

2016
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
solve problems. That that's what people

2017
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,870
solve problems. That that's what people
are. And sometimes they think that

2018
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
are. And sometimes they think that

2019
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,270
are. And sometimes they think that
solving the problem is behaving in a

2020
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
solving the problem is behaving in a

2021
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,430
solving the problem is behaving in a
certain way in order to get certain

2022
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
certain way in order to get certain

2023
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,550
certain way in order to get certain
sensations or whatever. But that's just

2024
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
sensations or whatever. But that's just

2025
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,150
sensations or whatever. But that's just
a theory. And as a theory, it's it's

2026
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
a theory. And as a theory, it's it's

2027
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,870
a theory. And as a theory, it's it's
very crude. And it it's not actually

2028
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
very crude. And it it's not actually

2029
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,109
very crude. And it it's not actually
true. And the reason why this rockstar

2030
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
true. And the reason why this rockstar

2031
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,670
true. And the reason why this rockstar
doesn't find that it's true for him is

2032
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
doesn't find that it's true for him is

2033
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,270
doesn't find that it's true for him is
that it's not true. In fact, uh it's not

2034
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
that it's not true. In fact, uh it's not

2035
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,550
that it's not true. In fact, uh it's not
true for anybody, even for aliens.

2036
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,560
true for anybody, even for aliens.

2037
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,349
true for anybody, even for aliens.
Um so so uh as I said we will have

2038
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
Um so so uh as I said we will have

2039
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,069
Um so so uh as I said we will have
different theories from aliens

2040
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
different theories from aliens

2041
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,470
different theories from aliens
&gt;&gt; but it won't be because we have

2042
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
&gt;&gt; but it won't be because we have

2043
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,910
&gt;&gt; but it won't be because we have
different nervous systems. Uh

2044
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:37,920
different nervous systems. Uh

2045
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,230
different nervous systems. Uh
&gt;&gt; I mean I could imagine an agent for whom

2046
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
&gt;&gt; I mean I could imagine an agent for whom

2047
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,870
&gt;&gt; I mean I could imagine an agent for whom
the rockstar's conjecture of how to live

2048
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
the rockstar's conjecture of how to live

2049
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,470
the rockstar's conjecture of how to live
a good life does does work for them

2050
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
a good life does does work for them

2051
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,670
a good life does does work for them
right?

2052
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:47,680
right?

2053
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,829
right?
&gt;&gt; Uh I I don't think so because because

2054
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:49,839
&gt;&gt; Uh I I don't think so because because

2055
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,790
&gt;&gt; Uh I I don't think so because because
the rockstar's criterion is is empty. It

2056
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:52,800
the rockstar's criterion is is empty. It

2057
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,950
the rockstar's criterion is is empty. It
doesn't require creativity to implement

2058
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
doesn't require creativity to implement

2059
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,550
doesn't require creativity to implement
it. So,

2060
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:56,560
it. So,

2061
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,430
it. So,
&gt;&gt; okay.

2062
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:57,440
&gt;&gt; okay.

2063
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,589
&gt;&gt; okay.
&gt;&gt; So, uh it's it's not going to sat it's

2064
00:46:59,589 --> 00:46:59,599
&gt;&gt; So, uh it's it's not going to sat it's

2065
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,510
&gt;&gt; So, uh it's it's not going to sat it's
not going to satisfy any human to be in

2066
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
not going to satisfy any human to be in

2067
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,109
not going to satisfy any human to be in
that state.

2068
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:05,119


2069
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,829
&gt;&gt; I need to think about this. [laughter]

2070
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
&gt;&gt; I need to think about this. [laughter]

2071
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,870
&gt;&gt; I need to think about this. [laughter]
Um

2072
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
Um

2073
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,870
Um
&gt;&gt; quite exactly.

2074
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880


2075
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,550
&gt;&gt; So, the second point you mentioned was

2076
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,560
&gt;&gt; So, the second point you mentioned was

2077
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,109
&gt;&gt; So, the second point you mentioned was
metamorality. How to improve moral

2078
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
metamorality. How to improve moral

2079
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,790
metamorality. How to improve moral
theories.

2080
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
theories.

2081
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,710
theories.
Um I'm afraid I can't remember the point

2082
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:20,720
Um I'm afraid I can't remember the point

2083
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,910
Um I'm afraid I can't remember the point
you made made on on that one. Is there

2084
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:23,920
you made made on on that one. Is there

2085
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,230
you made made on on that one. Is there
any chance you could repeat that bit?

2086
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:26,240
any chance you could repeat that bit?

2087
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,470
any chance you could repeat that bit?
&gt;&gt; Um I forgotten the question I was

2088
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480
&gt;&gt; Um I forgotten the question I was

2089
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,670
&gt;&gt; Um I forgotten the question I was
answering but I was saying that part of

2090
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
answering but I was saying that part of

2091
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,950
answering but I was saying that part of
uh moral improvement is improve not only

2092
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960
uh moral improvement is improve not only

2093
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,670
uh moral improvement is improve not only
improving moral theories but improving

2094
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:37,680
improving moral theories but improving

2095
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,270
improving moral theories but improving
moral meta theories. So just as we learn

2096
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,280
moral meta theories. So just as we learn

2097
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,670
moral meta theories. So just as we learn
to do better science both by by thinking

to do better science both by by thinking

2099
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,510
to do better science both by by thinking
uh you know what might cause things to

2100
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
uh you know what might cause things to

2101
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,030
uh you know what might cause things to
fall rather than rise up in the air and

2102
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
fall rather than rise up in the air and

2103
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,950
fall rather than rise up in the air and
by thinking that maybe the difference

2104
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
by thinking that maybe the difference

2105
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,750
by thinking that maybe the difference
maybe the way to go is to in have two

2106
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
maybe the way to go is to in have two

2107
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,550
maybe the way to go is to in have two
two or more hypotheses about that and

2108
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:58,560
two or more hypotheses about that and

2109
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,349
two or more hypotheses about that and
test the difference. And when Galileo

2110
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
test the difference. And when Galileo

2111
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,349
test the difference. And when Galileo
did that with balls rolling down an

2112
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
did that with balls rolling down an

2113
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,430
did that with balls rolling down an
inclined plane,

00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
inclined plane,

2115
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,790

um he was he had solved some meta

2116
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:08,800
um he was he had solved some meta

2117
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,190
um he was he had solved some meta
problem first because it he had to get

2118
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
problem first because it he had to get

2119
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,910
problem first because it he had to get
the idea that he could solve the problem

2120
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
the idea that he could solve the problem

2121
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,510
the idea that he could solve the problem
about things falling by solving the the

2122
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
about things falling by solving the the

2123
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,190
about things falling by solving the the
analogist problem with things rolling

2124
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
analogist problem with things rolling

2125
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,069
analogist problem with things rolling
down an inclined plane. That's not at

2126
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
down an inclined plane. That's not at

2127
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,990
down an inclined plane. That's not at
all obvious. In fact, I'm not I'm not

2128
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
all obvious. In fact, I'm not I'm not

2129
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,990
all obvious. In fact, I'm not I'm not
really sure that it's entirely true, but

2130
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
really sure that it's entirely true, but

2131
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,470
really sure that it's entirely true, but
it was true enough for for him to to to

2132
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
it was true enough for for him to to to

2133
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,950
it was true enough for for him to to to
make progress in his theories of inertia

2134
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
make progress in his theories of inertia

2135
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,190
make progress in his theories of inertia
and forces and so on. So, uh people who

2136
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
and forces and so on. So, uh people who

2137
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,510
and forces and so on. So, uh people who
didn't have the idea of testing theories

2138
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:39,520
didn't have the idea of testing theories

2139
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,030
didn't have the idea of testing theories
couldn't have made that progress that

2140
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
couldn't have made that progress that

2141
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,069
couldn't have made that progress that
Galileo made in physics.

2142
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:44,079
Galileo made in physics.

2143
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,270
Galileo made in physics.
So, they they they were deficient in

2144
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
So, they they they were deficient in

2145
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,670
So, they they they were deficient in
philosophy of physics.

2146
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:49,680
philosophy of physics.

2147
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,349
philosophy of physics.
And then what would be the analogy for

2148
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
And then what would be the analogy for

2149
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,750
And then what would be the analogy for
meta morality?

2150
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
meta morality?

2151
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,870
meta morality?
Um well we so my example if I remember

2152
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
Um well we so my example if I remember

2153
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,390
Um well we so my example if I remember
correctly maybe it's not a very good

2154
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
correctly maybe it's not a very good

2155
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,670
correctly maybe it's not a very good
example is is the the um trick of

2156
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
example is is the the um trick of

2157
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,589
example is is the the um trick of
putting yourself in the other person's

does one decide what to do. And then

2172
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:25,119
does one decide what to do. And then

2173
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,270
does one decide what to do. And then
there's the idea of well, one way is to

2174
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:27,280
there's the idea of well, one way is to

2175
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,270
there's the idea of well, one way is to
say supposing I had his theories and he

00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:29,280
say supposing I had his theories and he

2177
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,069
say supposing I had his theories and he
had my theories, what would happen?

Yeah, I think this is a good

Yeah, I think this is a good

and and to to make sure we can we can

No, that's only part of the answer

uh in the last century that has tailed

uh in the last century that has tailed

2203
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,069
uh in the last century that has tailed
off drastically. And it wasn't because

off drastically. And it wasn't because

was wrong. And we thought it was wrong

2213
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,870

because we have very general theories

Now, um in in the West, rationality and

2218
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
Now, um in in the West, rationality and

2219
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,990
Now, um in in the West, rationality and
and uh the there's there's just the idea

and uh the there's there's just the idea

2221
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,630
and uh the there's there's just the idea
in in the West there's the idea that

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,640
in in the West there's the idea that

2223
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,589
in in the West there's the idea that
that we can be mistaken and that the

that we can be mistaken and that the

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,150
that we can be mistaken and that the

good way of life is to not prevent the

2227
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,990
good way of life is to not prevent the
correction of errors. Therefore, we

2228
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000
correction of errors. Therefore, we

2229
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,430
correction of errors. Therefore, we
should judge, we should regard disputes

2230
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,440
should judge, we should regard disputes

2231
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,630
should judge, we should regard disputes
between people as being disputes between

between people as being disputes between

2233
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,109
between people as being disputes between

means that the criteria can't be

2259
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,510
means that the criteria can't be
dependent on the substrate in which the

2260
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:27,520
dependent on the substrate in which the

2261
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,750
dependent on the substrate in which the
ideas are instantiated.

2262
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,760
ideas are instantiated.

2263
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,150
ideas are instantiated.
Mhm.

2264
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,160
Mhm.

2265
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,710
Mhm.
&gt;&gt; So I I I do buy that AGIS could do moral

2266
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:36,720
&gt;&gt; So I I I do buy that AGIS could do moral

2267
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,349
&gt;&gt; So I I I do buy that AGIS could do moral
thinking. Uh they could come up with

2268
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:39,359
thinking. Uh they could come up with

2269
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,750
thinking. Uh they could come up with
moral conjectures and criticism just

2270
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
moral conjectures and criticism just

2271
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,109
moral conjectures and criticism just
like we can and that follows simply from

2272
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:45,119
like we can and that follows simply from

2273
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,790
like we can and that follows simply from
universality.

2274
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:46,800
universality.

2275
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,309
universality.
Um

2276
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:48,319
Um

2277
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,030
Um
the question then would be

2278
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,040
the question then would be

2279
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,710
the question then would be
let let's leave aside the question of

2280
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
let let's leave aside the question of

2281
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,990
let let's leave aside the question of
whether they would come to the same

2282
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,000
whether they would come to the same

2283
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,309
whether they would come to the same
conclusions or follow the same kind of

2284
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:56,319
conclusions or follow the same kind of

2285
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,990
conclusions or follow the same kind of
meta morality metamoral processes.

2286
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,000
meta morality metamoral processes.

2287
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,109
meta morality metamoral processes.
Uh would the AGI

2288
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
Uh would the AGI

2289
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,309
Uh would the AGI
be motivated to apply its creative

2290
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319
be motivated to apply its creative

2291
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,190
be motivated to apply its creative
conjecturing ability and criticism to

2292
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,200
conjecturing ability and criticism to

2293
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,589
conjecturing ability and criticism to
the domain of morality? Maybe it would

2294
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
the domain of morality? Maybe it would

2295
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,910
the domain of morality? Maybe it would
see it just as any other domain like

2296
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
see it just as any other domain like

2297
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,990
see it just as any other domain like
chemistry or physics or mathematics and

2298
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
chemistry or physics or mathematics and

2299
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,990
chemistry or physics or mathematics and
it thinks ah mathematics is not that

2300
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,000
it thinks ah mathematics is not that

2301
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,829
it thinks ah mathematics is not that
interesting. I do it when when I need

2302
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:21,839
interesting. I do it when when I need

2303
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,069
interesting. I do it when when I need
to. And morality yeah not super keen on

2304
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:24,079
to. And morality yeah not super keen on

2305
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,710
to. And morality yeah not super keen on
that. I do it when I need to.

2306
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:26,720
that. I do it when I need to.

2307
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,069
that. I do it when I need to.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, that's a moral theory

2308
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, that's a moral theory

2309
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,990
&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, that's a moral theory
and it it it's uh it's not unknown for

2310
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,000
and it it it's uh it's not unknown for

2311
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,829
and it it it's uh it's not unknown for
people to adopt that moral theory and

2312
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:35,839
people to adopt that moral theory and

2313
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,670
people to adopt that moral theory and
it's a bad moral theory that leads to

2314
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
it's a bad moral theory that leads to

2315
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,270
it's a bad moral theory that leads to
disaster. [laughter]

2316
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
disaster. [laughter]

2317
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,670
disaster. [laughter]
What disaster does it lead to?

2318
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:41,680
What disaster does it lead to?

2319
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,230
What disaster does it lead to?
&gt;&gt; Um, well, it's like it's it's an example

2320
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
&gt;&gt; Um, well, it's like it's it's an example

2321
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,030
&gt;&gt; Um, well, it's like it's it's an example
is the rock star I imagined.

2322
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040
is the rock star I imagined.

2323
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,829
is the rock star I imagined.
&gt;&gt; Um, so he he he he might say, well, I'm

2324
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
&gt;&gt; Um, so he he he he might say, well, I'm

2325
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,710
&gt;&gt; Um, so he he he he might say, well, I'm
interested in music. I'm interested in

2326
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:54,720
interested in music. I'm interested in

2327
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,150
interested in music. I'm interested in
um, you know, gratification.

2328
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
um, you know, gratification.

2329
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,750
um, you know, gratification.
Uh, I'm not terribly interested in

2330
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
Uh, I'm not terribly interested in

2331
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,510
Uh, I'm not terribly interested in
morality. You know, I have some

2332
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:01,520
morality. You know, I have some

2333
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,349
morality. You know, I have some
morality, but I'm not interested in

2334
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
morality, but I'm not interested in

2335
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,349
morality, but I'm not interested in
improving it. And uh you have if you

2336
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
improving it. And uh you have if you

2337
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,630
improving it. And uh you have if you
have a problem that your

2338
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
have a problem that your

2339
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,910
have a problem that your
existing morality is wrong, then you're

2340
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:13,920
existing morality is wrong, then you're

2341
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,349
existing morality is wrong, then you're
going to have no choice but to think

2342
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
going to have no choice but to think

2343
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,270
going to have no choice but to think
about it. Well, you have a choice of

2344
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
about it. Well, you have a choice of

2345
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,230
about it. Well, you have a choice of
thinking about it or being steeped in

2346
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
thinking about it or being steeped in

2347
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,030
thinking about it or being steeped in
error and and encountering disaster. And

2348
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
error and and encountering disaster. And

2349
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,910
error and and encountering disaster. And
the the disaster need not be that you

2350
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:25,920
the the disaster need not be that you

2351
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,069
the the disaster need not be that you
are destroyed or or starved to death or

2352
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
are destroyed or or starved to death or

2353
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,670
are destroyed or or starved to death or
anything. It could be just that um

2354
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:31,680
anything. It could be just that um

2355
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,430
anything. It could be just that um
you're sitting there with tears rolling

2356
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:33,440
you're sitting there with tears rolling

2357
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,510
you're sitting there with tears rolling
down your face with the lights dimmed

2358
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,520
down your face with the lights dimmed

2359
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,950
down your face with the lights dimmed
and you don't know what to do because uh

2360
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
and you don't know what to do because uh

2361
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,309
and you don't know what to do because uh
something in your mind has has decided

something in your mind has has decided

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,150
something in your mind has has decided
that

that

2365
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,549
that
a range of possible thoughts are not

2366
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
a range of possible thoughts are not

2367
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,549
a range of possible thoughts are not
going to be thought because you are not

00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
going to be thought because you are not

2369
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,069
going to be thought because you are not
the kind of person that thinks that

2370
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
the kind of person that thinks that

2371
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,470
the kind of person that thinks that
those thoughts. That can happen. It

2372
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:52,480
those thoughts. That can happen. It

2373
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,589
those thoughts. That can happen. It
happens to people all the time and it it

2374
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599
happens to people all the time and it it

2375
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,829
happens to people all the time and it it
it happens to people much more often

2376
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
it happens to people much more often

2377
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,990
it happens to people much more often
when there are when they've succumbed to

2378
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
when there are when they've succumbed to

2379
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,510
when there are when they've succumbed to
anti-rational memes than simply making a

2380
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:03,520
anti-rational memes than simply making a

2381
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,910
anti-rational memes than simply making a
series of mistakes. I mean, I think

2382
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
series of mistakes. I mean, I think

2383
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,069
series of mistakes. I mean, I think
making a series of mistakes is a rare

2384
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
making a series of mistakes is a rare

2385
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,190
making a series of mistakes is a rare
um cause of disaster.

2386
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
um cause of disaster.

2387
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,829
um cause of disaster.
Um unless the first one kills you or

2388
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839
Um unless the first one kills you or

2389
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,910
Um unless the first one kills you or
something. Um but but mostly when people

2390
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
something. Um but but mostly when people

2391
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,349
something. Um but but mostly when people
make um chronic mistakes, it's because

2392
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
make um chronic mistakes, it's because

2393
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,630
make um chronic mistakes, it's because
of anti-rational memes. So that that

2394
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
of anti-rational memes. So that that

2395
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,950
of anti-rational memes. So that that

Mhm. Mhm. So, we we've gone down this

2434
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
Mhm. Mhm. So, we we've gone down this

Mhm. Mhm. So, we we've gone down this

in every domain. Um,

2465
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,430

&gt;&gt; yeah. Then suppose you had these two

2466
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
&gt;&gt; yeah. Then suppose you had these two

2467
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,829
&gt;&gt; yeah. Then suppose you had these two

00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
agents and yet even if they investigated

2469
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,430

00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:15,440
morality they still did not converge on

2471
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,470

What is it about the hardware? I mean

then obviously the difference between

2538
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,240
then obviously the difference between

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,789
then obviously the difference between
them is software. If it's with different

still

yes it's because but then I don't see

00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:37,760
you you couldn't because you could have

2581
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,910
you you couldn't because you could have
a computer to help you with the with the

2582

a computer to help you with the with the

2583
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,190
a computer to help you with the with the
donkey work of that. You could say, "See

2584
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
donkey work of that. You could say, "See

00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,710
what would be the result of this train

2588
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:46,720

2589
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,390
of thought and it would go, zip." Well,
then then it turns out kill all humans.

2590
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
then then it turns out kill all humans.

2591
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,789
then then it turns out kill all humans.
Okay, now we've now we've narrowed it

2592
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:52,799
Okay, now we've now we've narrowed it

2593
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,789
Okay, now we've now we've narrowed it
down to one train of thought. Let's go

2594
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:54,799
down to one train of thought. Let's go

2595
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,589
down to one train of thought. Let's go
halfway along and and so on. You you

2596
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,599
halfway along and and so on. You you

2597
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,589
halfway along and and so on. You you
could by interval having you could find

2598
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
could by interval having you could find

2599
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,870
could by interval having you could find
out where where the difference arose

2600
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
out where where the difference arose

2601
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,349
out where where the difference arose
and

2602
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
and

2603
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,190
and
&gt;&gt; right. I wouldn't understand the reason

2604
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:05,200
&gt;&gt; right. I wouldn't understand the reason

2605
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,349
&gt;&gt; right. I wouldn't understand the reason
for that difference. I could I could do

2606
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
for that difference. I could I could do

2607
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,030
for that difference. I could I could do
test lots of different prompts and see

2608
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,040
test lots of different prompts and see

2609
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,430
test lots of different prompts and see

&gt;&gt; and then see where we start to differ.

2652
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
&gt;&gt; and then see where we start to differ.

2653
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,870

this would be better with an alien. So,

01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,119
this would be better with an alien. So,

01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,230
this would be better with an alien. So,
it it it is a carnivore and it's really

01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,240
it it it is a carnivore and it's really

it it it is a carnivore and it's really
deeply into its motivations that it it

um what whatever I mean other other

2666
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280
um what whatever I mean other other

2667
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,630
um what whatever I mean other other
entities. Um, then we could see then

2668
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,640
entities. Um, then we could see then

2669
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,109
entities. Um, then we could see then
then we could say to it, look, you're

2670
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
then we could say to it, look, you're

2671
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,190
then we could say to it, look, you're
only saying this because your genes say

2672
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:33,200
only saying this because your genes say

2673
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,750
only saying this because your genes say
you have to eat things. And it would

2674
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
you have to eat things. And it would

2675
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,309
you have to eat things. And it would
say, yes, but that's that's well and

2676
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:38,319
say, yes, but that's that's well and

2677
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,630
say, yes, but that's that's well and
good. That's how things should be. And

2678
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
good. That's how things should be. And

2679
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,630
good. That's how things should be. And
then we we could say to it, but you're

2680
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
then we we could say to it, but you're

2681
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,549
then we we could say to it, but you're
only saying that because uh your genes

2682
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
only saying that because uh your genes

2683
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,549
only saying that because uh your genes
say so. It's different from all the

2684
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
say so. It's different from all the

2685
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,309
say so. It's different from all the
other reasons you've given along all

2686
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,319
other reasons you've given along all

2687
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,030
other reasons you've given along all
that that chain of reasoning, your your

2688
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:55,040
that that chain of reasoning, your your

2689
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,430
that that chain of reasoning, your your
moral considerations. None of those

2690
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,440
moral considerations. None of those

2691
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,950
moral considerations. None of those
involve anything like that. This one

2692
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
involve anything like that. This one

2693
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,309
involve anything like that. This one
does. Why should this one override the

2694
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:04,319
does. Why should this one override the

2695
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,069
does. Why should this one override the
others?

2696
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:06,079
others?

2697
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,349
others?
And it might say,

2698
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
And it might say,

2699
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,390
And it might say,
well, because it tastes good. And then

2700
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
well, because it tastes good. And then

2701
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,390
well, because it tastes good. And then
again, you'd say that that's a different

2702
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
again, you'd say that that's a different

2703
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,069
again, you'd say that that's a different
kind of argument from the one you've

2704
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
kind of argument from the one you've

2705
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,870
kind of argument from the one you've
been using all the way up to now. like

2706
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:18,880
been using all the way up to now. like

Churchill was a young man and he was

2717
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,230
Churchill was a young man and he was
doing a book tour of America and he was

doing a book tour of America and he was

2719
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,910
doing a book tour of America and he was
introduced to Mark Twain who was quite

2720
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
introduced to Mark Twain who was quite

2721
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,710
introduced to Mark Twain who was quite
old and Churchill was quite young and

2722
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
old and Churchill was quite young and

2723
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,549
old and Churchill was quite young and
they were arguing about the whether the

2724
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
they were arguing about the whether the

2725
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,430
they were arguing about the whether the
British Empire was a moral thing and

2726
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:43,440
British Empire was a moral thing and

2727
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,829
British Empire was a moral thing and
Mark Twain was saying that it was

2728
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
Mark Twain was saying that it was

2729
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,990
Mark Twain was saying that it was
extremely immoral

2730
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:48,000
extremely immoral

2731
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,870
extremely immoral
And um Churchill tried his best to put

2732
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
And um Churchill tried his best to put

2733
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,430
And um Churchill tried his best to put
up an argument and then he says in his

01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,720
I would finally he beat me back to my

2739
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,710
I would finally he beat me back to my
fortress my country right or wrong. Now

2740
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
fortress my country right or wrong. Now

2741
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,829
fortress my country right or wrong. Now
see, [laughter]

2742
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
see, [laughter]

2743
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,150
see, [laughter]
Churchill was there saying that that he

2744
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
Churchill was there saying that that he

2745
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,069
Churchill was there saying that that he
was beaten back to irrationality

2746
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
was beaten back to irrationality

2747
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,829
was beaten back to irrationality
&gt;&gt; and and Mark Twain he and Mark Twain

2748
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
&gt;&gt; and and Mark Twain he and Mark Twain

2749
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:20,069
&gt;&gt; and and Mark Twain he and Mark Twain
both considered that Churchill had been

2750
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:20,079
both considered that Churchill had been

2751
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,390
both considered that Churchill had been
defeated in that argument.

2752
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
defeated in that argument.

2753
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,190
defeated in that argument.
But um I think Churchill the bottom line

2754
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
But um I think Churchill the bottom line

2755
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,430
But um I think Churchill the bottom line
was that Churchill was right and that

2756
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
was that Churchill was right and that

2757
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,670
was that Churchill was right and that
the real reason he couldn't think of a

2758
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
the real reason he couldn't think of a

2759
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,710
the real reason he couldn't think of a
better argument is that he didn't have

2760
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:34,720
better argument is that he didn't have

2761
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,069
better argument is that he didn't have
um a better theory of morality than he

2762
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079
um a better theory of morality than he

2763
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,510
um a better theory of morality than he
actually had. But

2764
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:39,520
actually had. But

2765
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,069
actually had. But
&gt;&gt; I mean when he Go on sorry

2766
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:42,079
&gt;&gt; I mean when he Go on sorry

2767
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,030
&gt;&gt; I mean when he Go on sorry
&gt;&gt; well he he he he did change after that.

2768
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,040
&gt;&gt; well he he he he did change after that.

2769
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,309
&gt;&gt; well he he he he did change after that.
He he he changed his justification which

2770
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
He he he changed his justification which

2771
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,670
He he he changed his justification which
often happens when when people have to

2772
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:51,680
often happens when when people have to

2773
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,390
often happens when when people have to
abandon a form of morality. They they

2774
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
abandon a form of morality. They they

2775
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,630
abandon a form of morality. They they
change the justification before they

2776
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
change the justification before they

2777
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,950
change the justification before they
change the bottom line.

2778
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:58,960
change the bottom line.

2779
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,390
change the bottom line.
And so um

2780
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
And so um

2781
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,630
And so um
Churchill then by the end it was about

2782
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:04,640
Churchill then by the end it was about

2783
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,670
Churchill then by the end it was about
it hinged on the bore war.

2784
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
it hinged on the bore war.

2785
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,549
it hinged on the bore war.
And um uh by the way, it's interesting

2786
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,559
And um uh by the way, it's interesting

2787
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,230
And um uh by the way, it's interesting
that neither of them made any mention of

2788
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,240
that neither of them made any mention of

2789
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,710
that neither of them made any mention of
the black people in South Africa. It was

2790
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:16,720
the black people in South Africa. It was

2791
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,430
the black people in South Africa. It was
all about the the rights of British

2792
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
all about the the rights of British

2793
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,589
all about the the rights of British
people and the rights of of Bo. And it's

2794
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
people and the rights of of Bo. And it's

2795
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,349
people and the rights of of Bo. And it's
obviously it it just didn't occur to

2796
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:25,359
obviously it it just didn't occur to

2797
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,309
obviously it it just didn't occur to
them that anyone else was involved.

2798
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:28,319
them that anyone else was involved.

2799
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,150
them that anyone else was involved.
&gt;&gt; Um

2800
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160
&gt;&gt; Um

2801
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,270
&gt;&gt; Um
&gt;&gt; uh so they

2802
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:33,280
&gt;&gt; uh so they

2803
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,150
&gt;&gt; uh so they
they were able to affect each other.

2804
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:36,160
they were able to affect each other.

2805
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,150
they were able to affect each other.
they were able to make each other uh

2806
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,160
they were able to make each other uh

2807
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,430
they were able to make each other uh
rethink their ideas and they were able

2808
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:43,440
rethink their ideas and they were able

2809
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,589
rethink their ideas and they were able
to see separately

2810
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:45,599
to see separately

2811
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,910
to see separately
whether an argument made sense or

2812
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
whether an argument made sense or

2813
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,789
whether an argument made sense or
whether they were right.

2814
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
whether they were right.

2815
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,789
whether they were right.
Uh and um obviously it there's there's

2816
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
Uh and um obviously it there's there's

2817
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,789
Uh and um obviously it there's there's
no law of the universe that says that

2818
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
no law of the universe that says that

2819
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,309
no law of the universe that says that
when that happens you will always go for

2820
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
when that happens you will always go for

2821
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:03,990
when that happens you will always go for
the argument which is probably quite

2822
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:04,000
the argument which is probably quite

2823
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,069
the argument which is probably quite
quite a good thing because our arguments

2824
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
quite a good thing because our arguments

2825
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,029
quite a good thing because our arguments
are not always better than our uh

2826
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:09,039
are not always better than our uh

2827
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,870
are not always better than our uh
intuition about what is right. So

2828
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
intuition about what is right. So

2829
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,589
intuition about what is right. So
&gt;&gt; yeah go ahead. For for example, I I

2830
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:15,599
&gt;&gt; yeah go ahead. For for example, I I

2831
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,829
&gt;&gt; yeah go ahead. For for example, I I
believe that causing animals suffering

2832
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
believe that causing animals suffering

2833
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,150
believe that causing animals suffering
is wrong. And yeah, I still eat meat

2834
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
is wrong. And yeah, I still eat meat

2835
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,470
is wrong. And yeah, I still eat meat
occasionally. So my moral deliberations

2836
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
occasionally. So my moral deliberations

2837
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,109
occasionally. So my moral deliberations
have not in fact changed my actions, at

2838
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
have not in fact changed my actions, at

2839
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,789
have not in fact changed my actions, at
least not wholly.

2840
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
least not wholly.

2841
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,750
least not wholly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you you have a a conflict in

2842
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you you have a a conflict in

2843
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,150
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you you have a a conflict in
your moral theories. So your your moral

2844
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,160
your moral theories. So your your moral

2845
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,109
your moral theories. So your your moral
theories. Uh so for a start it's not

2846
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:37,119
theories. Uh so for a start it's not

2847
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,270
theories. Uh so for a start it's not
true that you um

2848
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
true that you um

2849
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,270
true that you um
um that you let one override the other

2850
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
um that you let one override the other

2851
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,069
um that you let one override the other
because you have decided that the best

2852
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:48,079
because you have decided that the best

2853
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,549
because you have decided that the best
thing for you to do is to eat meat. It's

2854
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:50,559
thing for you to do is to eat meat. It's

2855
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,470
thing for you to do is to eat meat. It's
not that your

2856
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:52,480
not that your

2857
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,750
not that your
qualia have told you to do that.

2858
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:55,760
qualia have told you to do that.

2859
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,349
qualia have told you to do that.
&gt;&gt; It's your theory of what

2860
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
&gt;&gt; It's your theory of what

2861
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,470
&gt;&gt; It's your theory of what
&gt;&gt; I don't know. They're asking pretty

2862
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
&gt;&gt; I don't know. They're asking pretty

2863
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,870
&gt;&gt; I don't know. They're asking pretty
strongly. [laughter]

2864
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
strongly. [laughter]

2865
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,430
strongly. [laughter]
Uh, I don't think so because if somebody

2866
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,440
Uh, I don't think so because if somebody

2867
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,670
Uh, I don't think so because if somebody
if if a doctor told you that you that

2868
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
if if a doctor told you that you that

2869
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,349
if if a doctor told you that you that
you had six weeks to live unless you

2870
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
you had six weeks to live unless you

2871
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,630
you had six weeks to live unless you
stop eating meat, you'd stop.

2872
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:10,640
stop eating meat, you'd stop.

2873
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,230
stop eating meat, you'd stop.
&gt;&gt; I think that's because I take my own

2874
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
&gt;&gt; I think that's because I take my own

2875
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,069
&gt;&gt; I think that's because I take my own
suffering more seriously than animals

2876
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:14,079
suffering more seriously than animals

2877
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:14,470
suffering more seriously than animals
suffer.

2878
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
suffer.

2879
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,510
suffer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it uh it's not that.

2880
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it uh it's not that.

2881
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it uh it's not that.
&gt;&gt; It's not that. It's that you you take

2882
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
&gt;&gt; It's not that. It's that you you take

2883
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,270
&gt;&gt; It's not that. It's that you you take
reason more seriously than qualia.

2884
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
reason more seriously than qualia.

2885
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,309
reason more seriously than qualia.
But but there is also a reasonable

2886
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:26,319
But but there is also a reasonable

2887
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:30,710
But but there is also a reasonable
theory that says if we act on the maxim

2888
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:30,720
theory that says if we act on the maxim

2889
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,870
theory that says if we act on the maxim
of always suppressing alqualia we will

2890
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,880
of always suppressing alqualia we will

2891
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,430
of always suppressing alqualia we will
fail to take into account the inexplicit

2892
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:37,440
fail to take into account the inexplicit

2893
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,589
fail to take into account the inexplicit
knowledge that is in them.

2894
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
knowledge that is in them.

2895
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,910
knowledge that is in them.
&gt;&gt; Uh could you explain that?

2896
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
&gt;&gt; Uh could you explain that?

2897
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,270
&gt;&gt; Uh could you explain that?
&gt;&gt; So the the the knowledge that we have

2898
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280
&gt;&gt; So the the the knowledge that we have

2899
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,750
&gt;&gt; So the the the knowledge that we have
expressed in words and mathematical

2900
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
expressed in words and mathematical

2901
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,390
expressed in words and mathematical
theorems and scientific theories that's

2902
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
theorems and scientific theories that's

2903
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,349
theorems and scientific theories that's
only the tip of the iceberg.

2904
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:53,359
only the tip of the iceberg.

2905
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,950
only the tip of the iceberg.
Um to understand something you have to

2906
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
Um to understand something you have to

2907
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,789
Um to understand something you have to
have um a lot more theoretical

2908
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:00,799
have um a lot more theoretical

2909
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,109
have um a lot more theoretical
underpinning than just that. just to

2910
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
underpinning than just that. just to

2911
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,230
underpinning than just that. just to
know why

2912
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
know why

2913
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:11,109
know why
logic is valid and to to uh think why

2914
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:11,119
logic is valid and to to uh think why

2915
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,670
logic is valid and to to uh think why
when you are justified in taking

2916
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:13,680
when you are justified in taking

2917
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,349
when you are justified in taking
experience into account and when you

2918
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
experience into account and when you

2919
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:19,510
experience into account and when you
aren't and and what it I'm I'm trying to

2920
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,520
aren't and and what it I'm I'm trying to

2921
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,710
aren't and and what it I'm I'm trying to
trying to explain in words that not

2922
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:22,720
trying to explain in words that not

2923
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,309
trying to explain in words that not
everything can be explained in words. So

2924
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319
everything can be explained in words. So

2925
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,549
everything can be explained in words. So
there's only certain [laughter]

2926
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
there's only certain [laughter]

2927
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,950
there's only certain [laughter]
distance I can go along those lines. But

2928
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:28,960
distance I can go along those lines. But

2929
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,510
distance I can go along those lines. But
&gt;&gt; right

2930
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:29,520
&gt;&gt; right

2931
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,390
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt; but uh my usual example is that we don't

2932
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,400
&gt;&gt; but uh my usual example is that we don't

2933
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,910
&gt;&gt; but uh my usual example is that we don't
know the meanings of words. We don't

2934
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
know the meanings of words. We don't

2935
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,870
know the meanings of words. We don't
even know the meanings of any words um

2936
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:36,880
even know the meanings of any words um

2937
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,309
even know the meanings of any words um
without some inexplicit ideas because if

2938
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
without some inexplicit ideas because if

2939
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,910
without some inexplicit ideas because if
if all the meanings of words were

2940
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:41,920
if all the meanings of words were

2941
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,230
if all the meanings of words were
expressed in words then that would be a

2942
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
expressed in words then that would be a

2943
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,710
expressed in words then that would be a
circular definition.

2944
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
circular definition.

2945
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,349
circular definition.
So we so we we um

2946
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359
So we so we we um

2947
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,349
So we so we we um
uh there's a lot of knowledge in our

2948
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
uh there's a lot of knowledge in our

2949
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,150
uh there's a lot of knowledge in our
inexplicit ideas

2950
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
inexplicit ideas

2951
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,829
inexplicit ideas
and um if if we have a rule for always

2952
01:06:59,829 --> 01:06:59,839
and um if if we have a rule for always

2953
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,589
and um if if we have a rule for always

overriding them when they conflict with

2955
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,069
overriding them when they conflict with
explicit ideas then we'll be throwing

2956
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
explicit ideas then we'll be throwing

2957
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,549
explicit ideas then we'll be throwing
away most of the knowledge that we have.

2958
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:06,559
away most of the knowledge that we have.

2959
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,870
away most of the knowledge that we have.
the the better thing to do is is to when

2960
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
the the better thing to do is is to when

2961
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,150
the the better thing to do is is to when
when we encounter such a conflict is to

2962
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
when we encounter such a conflict is to

2963
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,910
when we encounter such a conflict is to
think about think critically about who

2964
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:15,920
think about think critically about who

2965
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,670
think about think critically about who
is right and probably they're both

2966
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
is right and probably they're both

2967
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,430
is right and probably they're both
wrong. So we can

2968
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
wrong. So we can

2969
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,270
wrong. So we can
&gt;&gt; I think my my qualia my positive qualia

2970
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
&gt;&gt; I think my my qualia my positive qualia

2971
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,069
&gt;&gt; I think my my qualia my positive qualia
when eating meat have I would argue

2972
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
when eating meat have I would argue

2973
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,750
when eating meat have I would argue
approximately zero moral content.

2974
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
approximately zero moral content.

2975
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,430
approximately zero moral content.
&gt;&gt; So I don't see that they're telling me

2976
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,440
&gt;&gt; So I don't see that they're telling me

2977
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,190
&gt;&gt; So I don't see that they're telling me
anything.

2978
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200
anything.

2979
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,150
anything.

that it's best for children to grow up

that it's best for children to grow up
never being comfortable. You always had

2988
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
never being comfortable. You always had

2989
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,309
never being comfortable. You always had
to make sure that they were somehow

2990
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:50,319
to make sure that they were somehow

2991
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,470
to make sure that they were somehow
uncomfortable that they didn't get to

2992
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:52,480
uncomfortable that they didn't get to

2993
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,069
uncomfortable that they didn't get to
eat what they wanted and um they didn't

2994
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:56,079
eat what they wanted and um they didn't

2995
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,309
eat what they wanted and um they didn't
get to sit in comfortable chairs. if

2996
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319

they asked for something then they

01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
they asked for something then they

2999
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,910
they asked for something then they
definitely shouldn't get that thing and

3000
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
definitely shouldn't get that thing and

3001
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,029
definitely shouldn't get that thing and
so on.

3002
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039

&gt;&gt; Um and Alice Miller thinks that that

3006
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
&gt;&gt; Um and Alice Miller thinks that that

3007
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,710
&gt;&gt; Um and Alice Miller thinks that that
that's that that caused Hitler. I I I

3008
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
that's that that caused Hitler. I I I

3009
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,109
that's that that caused Hitler. I I I
don't think that but I think it was

3010
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
don't think that but I think it was

3011
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,430
don't think that but I think it was
morally wrong and I think it was

3012
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:17,440
morally wrong and I think it was

3013
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,110
morally wrong and I think it was
practically wrong but the the practical

3014
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,120
practically wrong but the the practical

3015
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,910
practically wrong but the the practical
wrongness was not so obvious that it

3016
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:21,920
wrongness was not so obvious that it

3017
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,550
wrongness was not so obvious that it
that stood out for people at the time

3018
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,560
that stood out for people at the time

3019
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,470
that stood out for people at the time
for decades when this when this was

3020
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
for decades when this when this was

3021
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,990
for decades when this when this was
tried.

3022
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:28,000
tried.

3023
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,430
tried.
&gt;&gt; Um so and it it was powerful people

3024
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
&gt;&gt; Um so and it it was powerful people

3025
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,430
&gt;&gt; Um so and it it was powerful people
against powerless people. So the the

3026
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
against powerless people. So the the

3027
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,910
against powerless people. So the the
issue of needing to come to a consensus

3028
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:35,920
issue of needing to come to a consensus

3029
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,669
issue of needing to come to a consensus
didn't arise. So um people people did

3030
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
didn't arise. So um people people did

3031
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,470
didn't arise. So um people people did
that uh and it's wrong for the same

3032
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
that uh and it's wrong for the same

3033
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,149
that uh and it's wrong for the same
reason that you should not force

3034
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:44,159
reason that you should not force

3035
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,189
reason that you should not force
yourself to stop eating meat. It's

3036
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:47,199
yourself to stop eating meat. It's

3037
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:49,510
yourself to stop eating meat. It's
exactly the same.

3038
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
exactly the same.

3039
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,309
exactly the same.
I think um let let's go back to this uh

3040
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
I think um let let's go back to this uh

3041
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,070
I think um let let's go back to this uh

um

3060
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,400
um

3061
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,669
um
that would take a long time. And if we

3062
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
that would take a long time. And if we

3063
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,149
that would take a long time. And if we
were doing this with with AGIS, it's not

3064
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:24,159
were doing this with with AGIS, it's not

3065
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:27,349
were doing this with with AGIS, it's not
uh it's not a trivial process to try and

3066
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:27,359
uh it's not a trivial process to try and

3067
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,030
uh it's not a trivial process to try and
uh

3068
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,040
uh

3069
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,229
uh
disentangle from the enormous amount of

3070
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
disentangle from the enormous amount of

3071
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,510
disentangle from the enormous amount of
computations they're doing. the the

3072
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
computations they're doing. the the

3073
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,189
computations they're doing. the the
meaningful parts well it's all

3074
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
meaningful parts well it's all

3075
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,749
meaningful parts well it's all
meaningful but the the parts that can be

3076
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
meaningful but the the parts that can be

3077
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,070
meaningful but the the parts that can be
passed in our kind of language our

3078
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:42,080
passed in our kind of language our

3079
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,709
passed in our kind of language our
ontology uh to then communicate with

3080
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:44,719
ontology uh to then communicate with

them on a common ground re reasons I

3082
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:48,960
them on a common ground re reasons I

3083
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,269
them on a common ground re reasons I
mean reasons are not in the zeros and

3084
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
mean reasons are not in the zeros and

3085
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,349
mean reasons are not in the zeros and
ones directly we have to interpret them

3086
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:53,359
ones directly we have to interpret them

3087
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,709
ones directly we have to interpret them
as reasons so this sounds like one a big

3088
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:56,719
as reasons so this sounds like one a big

3089
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,630
as reasons so this sounds like one a big
engineering challenge and two something

3090
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
engineering challenge and two something

3091
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,189
engineering challenge and two something
that would take an awful lot of time so

3092
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
that would take an awful lot of time so

3093
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:02,709
that would take an awful lot of time so
then the question would be like would

3094
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:02,719
then the question would be like would

3095
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,709
then the question would be like would
the AGI

3096
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
the AGI

3097
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,790
the AGI
motivated to wait around while we did

3098
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
motivated to wait around while we did

3099
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,950
motivated to wait around while we did
this. Uh wouldn't it just if we have

3100
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
this. Uh wouldn't it just if we have

3101
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,669
this. Uh wouldn't it just if we have
diverging values and this is going to

3102
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
diverging values and this is going to

3103
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,990
diverging values and this is going to
take the next 10 years to figure out

3104
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:14,000
take the next 10 years to figure out

3105
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,470
take the next 10 years to figure out
think oh well too bad it's going to take

3106
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:16,480
think oh well too bad it's going to take

3107
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,910
think oh well too bad it's going to take
10 years.

3108
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:17,920
10 years.

3109
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,870
10 years.
&gt;&gt; This AGI is going to start off with our

3110
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:20,880
&gt;&gt; This AGI is going to start off with our

3111
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,189
&gt;&gt; This AGI is going to start off with our
values presumably because we we are the

3112
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
values presumably because we we are the

3113
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,310
values presumably because we we are the
ones who brought it up from from

3114
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
ones who brought it up from from

3115
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,790
ones who brought it up from from
scratch. So it started off with our

3116
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
scratch. So it started off with our

3117
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,070
scratch. So it started off with our
values and in trying to improve them, it

3118
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:32,080
values and in trying to improve them, it

3119
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,350
values and in trying to improve them, it
came to values that seem to us

3120
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
came to values that seem to us

3121
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,550
came to values that seem to us
very off and we we can't and and when it

3122
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
very off and we we can't and and when it

3123
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,310
very off and we we can't and and when it
tries to explain to us why it came up

3124
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
tries to explain to us why it came up

3125
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,750
tries to explain to us why it came up
with those values,

3126
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760
with those values,

3127
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,550
with those values,
&gt;&gt; then we don't get it. We just don't get

3128
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:44,560
&gt;&gt; then we don't get it. We just don't get

3129
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,550
&gt;&gt; then we don't get it. We just don't get
it. We think it must be it that's made a

3130
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
it. We think it must be it that's made a

3131
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,910
it. We think it must be it that's made a
mistake.

3132
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:47,920
mistake.

3133
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,990
mistake.
&gt;&gt; Um this is the situation that the human

3134
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,000
&gt;&gt; Um this is the situation that the human

3135
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,790
&gt;&gt; Um this is the situation that the human
race has always been in and especially

3136
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
race has always been in and especially

3137
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,110
race has always been in and especially
has been in since the Enlightenment.

3138
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,120
has been in since the Enlightenment.

3139
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,630
has been in since the Enlightenment.
This is the um problem of how to get on

3140
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
This is the um problem of how to get on

3141
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,630
This is the um problem of how to get on
with teenagers.

3142
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:00,640
with teenagers.

3143
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,510
with teenagers.
Um people people have been complaining

3144
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:05,520
Um people people have been complaining

3145
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,070
Um people people have been complaining
for centuries and in fact millennia

3146
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:08,080
for centuries and in fact millennia

3147
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,910
for centuries and in fact millennia
although it's got worse and worse since

3148
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
although it's got worse and worse since

3149
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,750
although it's got worse and worse since
the enlightenment that that teenagers in

3150
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,760
the enlightenment that that teenagers in

3151
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,270
the enlightenment that that teenagers in
this generation are uniquely bad

3152
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:17,280
this generation are uniquely bad

3153
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,070
this generation are uniquely bad
and and they are uniquely bad for

3154
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,080
and and they are uniquely bad for

3155
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,270
and and they are uniquely bad for
basically mechanical reasons

3156
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,280
basically mechanical reasons

3157
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,070
basically mechanical reasons
uh because of their hormones

3158
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
uh because of their hormones

3159
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,910
uh because of their hormones
um because of their um uh social media

3160
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
um because of their um uh social media

3161
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,750
um because of their um uh social media
media because of their mobile phones and

3162
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
media because of their mobile phones and

3163
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,709
media because of their mobile phones and
so on. And and so we want to use force

3164
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:36,719
so on. And and so we want to use force

3165
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,070
so on. And and so we want to use force
to settle the issue. And that is a bad

3166
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,080
to settle the issue. And that is a bad

3167
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,709
to settle the issue. And that is a bad
idea because when it is when they are

3168
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,719
idea because when it is when they are

3169
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,189
idea because when it is when they are
worse, they will be worse for some

3170
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
worse, they will be worse for some

3171
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,990
worse, they will be worse for some
reason which seems like let's suppose

3172
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
reason which seems like let's suppose

3173
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,430
reason which seems like let's suppose
for the sake of argument that they are

3174
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
for the sake of argument that they are

3175
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,630
for the sake of argument that they are
worse that their values are worse. Then

3176
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
worse that their values are worse. Then

3177
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,470
worse that their values are worse. Then
they will be worse because they seemed

3178
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
they will be worse because they seemed

3179
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,430
they will be worse because they seemed
better but in fact aren't.

3180
01:11:59,430 --> 01:11:59,440
better but in fact aren't.

3181
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,310
better but in fact aren't.
And that is a point of view that is

3182
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
And that is a point of view that is

3183
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,910
And that is a point of view that is
extremely close to ours and uh we have a

3184
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:07,920
extremely close to ours and uh we have a

3185
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,669
extremely close to ours and uh we have a
moral duty since we have

3186
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
moral duty since we have

3187
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,470
moral duty since we have
decanted them into a world that has this

3188
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:14,480
decanted them into a world that has this

3189
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,189
decanted them into a world that has this
problem this inherent problem in it. It

3190
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
problem this inherent problem in it. It

3191
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,470
problem this inherent problem in it. It
is up to us to try to solve this.

3192
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
is up to us to try to solve this.

3193
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,070
is up to us to try to solve this.
Um, it could be that we will fail to

3194
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
Um, it could be that we will fail to

3195
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,630
Um, it could be that we will fail to
solve it and that civilization will end

3196
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:26,640
solve it and that civilization will end

3197
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,310
solve it and that civilization will end
after another generation because the

3198
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
after another generation because the

3199
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,510
after another generation because the
AGIS will destroy us all. What will not

3200
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:31,520
AGIS will destroy us all. What will not

3201
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,750
AGIS will destroy us all. What will not
happen is that they'll go on living

3202
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,760
happen is that they'll go on living

3203
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,229
happen is that they'll go on living
happily despite well actually even that

3204
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
happily despite well actually even that

3205
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,669
happily despite well actually even that
could happen. It could be that they

3206
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
could happen. It could be that they

3207
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,630
could happen. It could be that they
destroy us, go on living happily and

3208
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
destroy us, go on living happily and

3209
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,070
destroy us, go on living happily and
then realize that they shouldn't have

3210
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:42,080
then realize that they shouldn't have

3211
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,550
then realize that they shouldn't have
destroyed us and then go on living

3212
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
destroyed us and then go on living

3213
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,830
destroyed us and then go on living
happily.

3214
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
happily.

3215
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,709
happily.
&gt;&gt; Right? This is this is all very you know

3216
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
&gt;&gt; Right? This is this is all very you know

3217
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,830
&gt;&gt; Right? This is this is all very you know
that's that's that's

3218
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
that's that's that's

3219
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,669
that's that's that's
in the same category of artificiality as

3220
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
in the same category of artificiality as

3221
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,470
in the same category of artificiality as
saying we may find a reason that dark

01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
saying we may find a reason that dark

01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,030
saying we may find a reason that dark
energy is going to burn us all up next

3224
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,040
energy is going to burn us all up next

3225
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,630
energy is going to burn us all up next
year.

3226
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,640

3227
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,790
year.
It could be could be that our theories

3228
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,800
It could be could be that our theories

3229
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,590
It could be could be that our theories
of physics are wrong in exactly that way

3230
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
of physics are wrong in exactly that way

3231
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,590
of physics are wrong in exactly that way
in which case we're doomed. But as I

3232
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:11,600
in which case we're doomed. But as I

3233
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,430
in which case we're doomed. But as I
said before

3234
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
said before

3235
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,590
said before
there is no such cloud on the horizon.

3236
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,600
there is no such cloud on the horizon.

3237
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,910
there is no such cloud on the horizon.
All the things that are cited as

3238
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:17,920
All the things that are cited as

3239
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,830
All the things that are cited as
evidence for that, like

3240
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
evidence for that, like

3241
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,830
evidence for that, like
the teenagers seem to like their mobile

3242
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
the teenagers seem to like their mobile

3243
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,229
the teenagers seem to like their mobile
phones better than their school lessons,

3244
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:26,239
phones better than their school lessons,

3245
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,669
phones better than their school lessons,
are evidence in the other direction.

3246
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:29,679
are evidence in the other direction.

3247
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,910
are evidence in the other direction.
So, uh, as I say, we can't you can't

3248
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:33,920
So, uh, as I say, we can't you can't

3249
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,189
So, uh, as I say, we can't you can't
prove that we're not doomed. But, uh, I

3250
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199
prove that we're not doomed. But, uh, I

3251
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,950
prove that we're not doomed. But, uh, I
will be very surprised if we're doomed

3252
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:38,960
will be very surprised if we're doomed

3253
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,070
will be very surprised if we're doomed
by that method.

3254
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,080
by that method.

3255
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,189
by that method.
I think a comet impacting the earth is

3256
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
I think a comet impacting the earth is

3257
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,149
I think a comet impacting the earth is
is much more much more plausible.

3258
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
is much more much more plausible.

3259
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,110
is much more much more plausible.
&gt;&gt; I see. There's there's there's never a

3260
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
&gt;&gt; I see. There's there's there's never a

3261
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,350
&gt;&gt; I see. There's there's there's never a
limit on the size of error you can make

3262
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
limit on the size of error you can make

3263
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,030
limit on the size of error you can make
even in moral thinking. Yes.

3264
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,040
even in moral thinking. Yes.

3265
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,030
even in moral thinking. Yes.
&gt;&gt; And so AGIS could also make a mistake.

3266
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,040
&gt;&gt; And so AGIS could also make a mistake.

3267
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,350
&gt;&gt; And so AGIS could also make a mistake.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

3268
01:13:59,350 --> 01:13:59,360
&gt;&gt; Yes.

3269
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,030
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Decide to wipe us out.

3270
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
&gt;&gt; Decide to wipe us out.

3271
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,669
&gt;&gt; Decide to wipe us out.
&gt;&gt; But then eventually because of their

3272
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
&gt;&gt; But then eventually because of their

3273
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,510
&gt;&gt; But then eventually because of their
infinite explanatory reach, if they

3274
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
infinite explanatory reach, if they

3275
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,790
infinite explanatory reach, if they
don't wipe themselves out, they'll

3276
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:06,800
don't wipe themselves out, they'll

3277
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,390
don't wipe themselves out, they'll
eventually realize they made a mistake

3278
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
eventually realize they made a mistake

3279
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,470
eventually realize they made a mistake
in wiping us out. Yes.

3280
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:10,480
in wiping us out. Yes.

3281
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,750
in wiping us out. Yes.
&gt;&gt; I see. Um,

3282
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:13,760
&gt;&gt; I see. Um,

3283
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,590
&gt;&gt; I see. Um,
you mentioned that they would start off

3284
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
you mentioned that they would start off

3285
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,510
you mentioned that they would start off
with our values and therefore in a sense

3286
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:19,520
with our values and therefore in a sense

3287
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,830
with our values and therefore in a sense
they would be like our descendants

3288
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
they would be like our descendants

3289
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,790
they would be like our descendants
&gt;&gt; and that assuming their values if they

3290
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:24,800
&gt;&gt; and that assuming their values if they

3291
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,669
&gt;&gt; and that assuming their values if they
diverged from ours are necessarily worse

3292
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679
diverged from ours are necessarily worse

3293
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,950
diverged from ours are necessarily worse
would be like assuming our descendants

3294
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
would be like assuming our descendants

3295
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,590
would be like assuming our descendants
not even one not even 10,000 years in

3296
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:33,600
not even one not even 10,000 years in

3297
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,830
not even one not even 10,000 years in
the future but a single generation are

3298
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:35,840
the future but a single generation are

3299
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,990
the future but a single generation are
worse. Um

3300
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,000
worse. Um

3301
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,229
worse. Um
&gt;&gt; I I agree with this and I think if we

3302
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:40,239
&gt;&gt; I I agree with this and I think if we

3303
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:44,070
&gt;&gt; I I agree with this and I think if we
did manage if AGIS did in fact start off

3304
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,080
did manage if AGIS did in fact start off

3305
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,830
did manage if AGIS did in fact start off
with our values then they should be

3306
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
with our values then they should be

3307
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,870
with our values then they should be
allowed to evolve their values hopefully

3308
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
allowed to evolve their values hopefully

3309
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,270
allowed to evolve their values hopefully
in discussion with us just as we are

3310
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:53,280
in discussion with us just as we are

3311
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,630
in discussion with us just as we are
allowed to to modify ours. But then the

3312
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
allowed to to modify ours. But then the

3313
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,030
allowed to to modify ours. But then the
question of whether AIs would in fact

3314
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,040
question of whether AIs would in fact

3315
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,189
question of whether AIs would in fact
start off with our values, that looks an

3316
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:01,199
start off with our values, that looks an

3317
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,390
start off with our values, that looks an
awful lot like the alignment problem of

3318
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
awful lot like the alignment problem of

3319
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,790
awful lot like the alignment problem of
successfully imbuing our values into

3320
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
successfully imbuing our values into

3321
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,030
successfully imbuing our values into
AIS. And I don't see that we would

3322
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
AIS. And I don't see that we would

3323
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,270
AIS. And I don't see that we would
necessarily succeed in that. I think

3324
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280
necessarily succeed in that. I think

3325
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,990
necessarily succeed in that. I think
it's possible we could create universal

3326
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
it's possible we could create universal

3327
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,910
it's possible we could create universal
explainers, if I'm using your language

3328
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
explainers, if I'm using your language

3329
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,709
explainers, if I'm using your language
correctly, that do not start off with

3330
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:20,719
correctly, that do not start off with

3331
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:23,189
correctly, that do not start off with
our values. They might start off much

3332
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
our values. They might start off much

3333
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,030
our values. They might start off much
worse than our values. uh and therefore

3334
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,040
worse than our values. uh and therefore

3335
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,390
worse than our values. uh and therefore
&gt;&gt; their their values will be caused by the

3336
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
&gt;&gt; their their values will be caused by the

3337
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,950
&gt;&gt; their their values will be caused by the
initial state of their computation.

3338
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960
initial state of their computation.

3339
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:39,669
initial state of their computation.
&gt;&gt; Yes. it and um I don't see ho how how

3340
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:39,679
&gt;&gt; Yes. it and um I don't see ho how how

3341
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,550
&gt;&gt; Yes. it and um I don't see ho how how
how that could possibly be done except

3342
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
how that could possibly be done except

3343
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,709
how that could possibly be done except
by making them contentless or almost

3344
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
by making them contentless or almost

3345
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,149
by making them contentless or almost
contentless or I mean just like babies

3346
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:48,159
contentless or I mean just like babies

3347
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:52,149
contentless or I mean just like babies
grow up with start start off with no

theories of physics or mathematics or

3350
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:54,159
theories of physics or mathematics or

3351
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,830
theories of physics or mathematics or
morality

3352
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:55,840
morality

3353
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,390
morality
um and they they they

3354
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
um and they they they

3355
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,149
um and they they they
get all their theories by conjecture and

3356
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:00,159
get all their theories by conjecture and

3357
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,550
get all their theories by conjecture and
criticism. If we start them off, if we

3358
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:02,560
criticism. If we start them off, if we

3359
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,310
criticism. If we start them off, if we
start an AGI off by being the equivalent

3360
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,320
start an AGI off by being the equivalent

3361
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,550
start an AGI off by being the equivalent
of a of a 21-year-old human,

3362
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
of a of a 21-year-old human,

3363
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,310
of a of a 21-year-old human,
um, then they'll all be the same and

3364
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
um, then they'll all be the same and

3365
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,229
um, then they'll all be the same and
we'll lose all the benefit of having

3366
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
we'll lose all the benefit of having

3367
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,070
we'll lose all the benefit of having
one.

3368
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
one.

3369
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,030
one.
So,

3370
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
So,

3371
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,709
So,
&gt;&gt; don't babies start off with the moral

3372
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
&gt;&gt; don't babies start off with the moral

3373
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,390
&gt;&gt; don't babies start off with the moral
theory that they should get what they

3374
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,400
theory that they should get what they

3375
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,390
theory that they should get what they
want.

3376
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,400
want.

3377
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,110
want.
&gt;&gt; Everyone else be damned.

3378
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,120
&gt;&gt; Everyone else be damned.

3379
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,110
&gt;&gt; Everyone else be damned.
&gt;&gt; Um,

3380
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
&gt;&gt; Um,

3381
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,110
&gt;&gt; Um,
no. Uh, I mean, some people think that

3382
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
no. Uh, I mean, some people think that

3383
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,950
no. Uh, I mean, some people think that
humans start off like that, but I I

3384
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
humans start off like that, but I I

3385
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,270
humans start off like that, but I I
think that's that's um basically

3386
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,280
think that's that's um basically

3387
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,830
think that's that's um basically
impossible. And even if it were true,

3388
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:35,840
impossible. And even if it were true,

3389
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,510
impossible. And even if it were true,
they would the main thing that the main

3390
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,520
they would the main thing that the main

3391
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,870
they would the main thing that the main
thing that a baby or an AGI is doing is

3392
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:40,880
thing that a baby or an AGI is doing is

3393
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,910
thing that a baby or an AGI is doing is
it's trying to solve problems. It's

3394
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
it's trying to solve problems. It's

3395
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,229
it's trying to solve problems. It's
trying to create the solutions to

3396
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
trying to create the solutions to

3397
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,990
trying to create the solutions to
problems by changing its existing ideas.

3398
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:50,000
problems by changing its existing ideas.

3399
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,229
problems by changing its existing ideas.
What it's initial existing ideas are is

3400
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
What it's initial existing ideas are is

3401
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,030
What it's initial existing ideas are is
somewhat irrelevant.

3402
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,040
somewhat irrelevant.

3403
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,590
somewhat irrelevant.
um because because of the G and because

3404
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
um because because of the G and because

3405
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,550
um because because of the G and because
of the creative and person and all those

3406
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:04,560
of the creative and person and all those

01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,110

constellation of properties

3408
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:07,120
constellation of properties

3409
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,110
constellation of properties
um they they can improve on their ideas.

3410
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
um they they can improve on their ideas.

3411
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,669
um they they can improve on their ideas.
So if we started them off as a baby with

3412
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
So if we started them off as a baby with

3413
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,070
So if we started them off as a baby with
arbitrary ideas, you know, if we started

3414
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
arbitrary ideas, you know, if we started

3415
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,630
arbitrary ideas, you know, if we started
off with chimp type ideas or whatever,

3416
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
off with chimp type ideas or whatever,

3417
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,510
off with chimp type ideas or whatever,
as long as they had human type

3418
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
as long as they had human type

3419
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,750
as long as they had human type
um creative thinking, they would soon

3420
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760
um creative thinking, they would soon

3421
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,950
um creative thinking, they would soon
lose their chimp like ideas. And I mean,

3422
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
lose their chimp like ideas. And I mean,

3423
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,709
lose their chimp like ideas. And I mean,
you think that it could have a long-term

3424
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
you think that it could have a long-term

3425
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,790
you think that it could have a long-term
consequence that eventually it'll cause

3426
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
consequence that eventually it'll cause

3427
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,149
consequence that eventually it'll cause
them to want to wipe out the world or or

3428
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159
them to want to wipe out the world or or

3429
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,550
them to want to wipe out the world or or
something, but I I as I said, I I don't

3430
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
something, but I I as I said, I I don't

3431
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,950
something, but I I as I said, I I don't
think so. uh and I think far easier and

3432
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:42,960
think so. uh and I think far easier and

3433
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,350
think so. uh and I think far easier and
more efficient thing is for them to

3434
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
more efficient thing is for them to

3435
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,870
more efficient thing is for them to
start out with the just a basic

3436
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:46,880
start out with the just a basic

3437
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,270
start out with the just a basic
operating system.

3438
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
operating system.

3439
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,070
operating system.
um that allow that that uh allows them

3440
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:52,080
um that allow that that uh allows them

3441
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,550
um that allow that that uh allows them
to interact with the world and thereby

3442
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
to interact with the world and thereby

3443
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,030
to interact with the world and thereby
acquire problems have expect they have

3444
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
acquire problems have expect they have

3445
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,310
acquire problems have expect they have
expectations which can be violated

3446
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,320
expectations which can be violated

3447
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,990
expectations which can be violated
um where they can go choose the

3448
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,000
um where they can go choose the

3449
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,669
um where they can go choose the
direction that they can go and improve

3450
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:03,679
direction that they can go and improve

3451
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,550
direction that they can go and improve
them and they will be doing that by

3452
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:06,560
them and they will be doing that by

3453
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,790
them and they will be doing that by
interacting with the with the human

3454
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
interacting with the with the human

3455
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,030
interacting with the with the human
humans who are bringing them up and also

3456
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,040
humans who are bringing them up and also

with the rest of society.
Um, now if you started them off with the

3460
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
Um, now if you started them off with the

3461
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,189
Um, now if you started them off with the
values of the Chinese Communist Party,

3462
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:19,199
values of the Chinese Communist Party,

3463
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:23,189
values of the Chinese Communist Party,
then we might be in trouble. Um, I don't

3464
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:23,199
then we might be in trouble. Um, I don't

3465
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,430
then we might be in trouble. Um, I don't
know. I don't know what what happens if

3466
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:25,440
know. I don't know what what happens if

3467
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,030
know. I don't know what what happens if
you maybe such a person would in would

3468
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
you maybe such a person would in would

3469
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,870
you maybe such a person would in would
immediately think there's something

3470
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:30,880
immediately think there's something

3471
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,950
immediately think there's something
really wrong with the way I'm thinking.

3472
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:32,960
really wrong with the way I'm thinking.

3473
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,750
really wrong with the way I'm thinking.
Uh, can I can I find a better way of

3474
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
Uh, can I can I find a better way of

3475
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,350
Uh, can I can I find a better way of
thinking? Um, I don't know. But we

3476
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
thinking? Um, I don't know. But we

3477
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,750
thinking? Um, I don't know. But we
wouldn't do that, would we?

3478
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:41,760
wouldn't do that, would we?

3479
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,910
wouldn't do that, would we?
Well, I I I think my argument would be

3480
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
Well, I I I think my argument would be

3481
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,430
Well, I I I think my argument would be
that we we don't know how to reliably

3482
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
that we we don't know how to reliably

3483
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,229
that we we don't know how to reliably
implant any values, good, bad,

3484
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:50,239
implant any values, good, bad,

3485
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,550
implant any values, good, bad,
&gt;&gt; right? Reli right. Reliably is the last

3486
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
&gt;&gt; right? Reli right. Reliably is the last

3487
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,110
&gt;&gt; right? Reli right. Reliably is the last
thing we want

3488
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
thing we want

3489
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,830
thing we want
&gt;&gt; because we want to we want to uh implant

3490
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:57,840
&gt;&gt; because we want to we want to uh implant

3491
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,590
&gt;&gt; because we want to we want to uh implant
creativity. We want if if if the initial

3492
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
creativity. We want if if if the initial

3493
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,790
creativity. We want if if if the initial
state is unreliable and gets changed and

3494
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:04,800
state is unreliable and gets changed and

3495
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,110
state is unreliable and gets changed and
that that's fine. That's good. That's

3496
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
that that's fine. That's good. That's

3497
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,350
that that's fine. That's good. That's
what we're aiming for. We're aiming to

3498
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
what we're aiming for. We're aiming to

3499
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,630
what we're aiming for. We're aiming to
give it the G property,

3500
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
give it the G property,

3501
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,790
give it the G property,
&gt;&gt; which [clears throat] it can't have if

3502
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
&gt;&gt; which [clears throat] it can't have if

3503
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,790
&gt;&gt; which [clears throat] it can't have if
it's got, for example, alignment built

3504
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
it's got, for example, alignment built

3505
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,470
it's got, for example, alignment built
in

3506
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
in

3507
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,550
in
or Marxism built in.

3508
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,560
or Marxism built in.

3509
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,070
or Marxism built in.
So, so in a sense,

3510
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,080
So, so in a sense,

3511
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,990
So, so in a sense,
so maybe your argument is that it

3512
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:28,000
so maybe your argument is that it

3513
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,070
so maybe your argument is that it
doesn't really so much matter what

3514
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,080
doesn't really so much matter what

3515
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,669
doesn't really so much matter what
values it would start off with, provided

3516
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:33,679
values it would start off with, provided

3517
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,030
values it would start off with, provided
it has this creative ability to to

3518
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:37,040
it has this creative ability to to

3519
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,950
it has this creative ability to to
question moral explanations and make

3520
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:38,960
question moral explanations and make

3521
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,470
question moral explanations and make
improvement on them,

3522
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,480
improvement on them,

3523
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,390
improvement on them,
&gt;&gt; then it will come to similar conclusions

3524
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:44,400
&gt;&gt; then it will come to similar conclusions

3525
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,630
&gt;&gt; then it will come to similar conclusions
as we will or we'll be able to talk it

3526
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
as we will or we'll be able to talk it

3527
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,910
as we will or we'll be able to talk it
through.

3528
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
through.

3529
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,370
through.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Or we'll fail and die. Okay.

3530
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:51,380
&gt;&gt; Yes. Or we'll fail and die. Okay.

3531
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:54,070
&gt;&gt; Yes. Or we'll fail and die. Okay.
[laughter]

3532
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:54,080


3533
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,709
&gt;&gt; But but that that is the same as if we

3534
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:56,719
&gt;&gt; But but that that is the same as if we

3535
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,189
&gt;&gt; But but that that is the same as if we
were talking about astronomy. I mean

3536
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199
were talking about astronomy. I mean

3537
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,790
were talking about astronomy. I mean
that's the same with all human

3538
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:00,800
that's the same with all human

3539
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,310
that's the same with all human
knowledge.

3540
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
knowledge.

3541
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,950
knowledge.
uh that it that we can er

3542
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:04,960
uh that it that we can er

3543
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,709
uh that it that we can er
&gt;&gt; we can er and there's a limit to how

3544
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:06,719
&gt;&gt; we can er and there's a limit to how

3545
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,870
&gt;&gt; we can er and there's a limit to how
large a mistake we can make

3546
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
large a mistake we can make

3547
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,350
large a mistake we can make
&gt;&gt; right because it's possible that an AI

3548
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
&gt;&gt; right because it's possible that an AI

3549
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,030
&gt;&gt; right because it's possible that an AI
could start off with what we would

3550
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:15,040
could start off with what we would

3551
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,270
could start off with what we would
consider the wrong values and would

3552
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
consider the wrong values and would

3553
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,030
consider the wrong values and would
eventually come to better values uh

3554
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
eventually come to better values uh

3555
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,189
eventually come to better values uh
values that we would also understand as

3556
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:23,199
values that we would also understand as

3557
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,350
values that we would also understand as
better but that that would take an

3558
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:25,360
better but that that would take an

3559
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,669
better but that that would take an
extremely long time and in the meantime

3560
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
extremely long time and in the meantime

3561
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,870
extremely long time and in the meantime
it would go via some values that we

3562
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:30,880
it would go via some values that we

3563
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,149
it would go via some values that we
would think of as

3564
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:32,159
would think of as

3565
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:33,350
would think of as
and would lead to

3566
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:33,360
and would lead to

3567
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,590
and would lead to
&gt;&gt; taking us on the inside as it were

3568
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
&gt;&gt; taking us on the inside as it were

3569
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,350
&gt;&gt; taking us on the inside as it were
without ever passing through the values

3570
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:37,360
without ever passing through the values

3571
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,790
without ever passing through the values
that we have.

3572
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,800
that we have.

3573
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,910
that we have.
&gt;&gt; Uh yes. Yeah.

3574
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
&gt;&gt; Uh yes. Yeah.

3575
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,110
&gt;&gt; Uh yes. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it would be interacting with us

3576
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
&gt;&gt; But it would be interacting with us

3577
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,870
&gt;&gt; But it would be interacting with us
&gt;&gt; continuously at least through the first

3578
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:44,880
&gt;&gt; continuously at least through the first

3579
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,189
&gt;&gt; continuously at least through the first
part of this until it got to you know as

3580
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
part of this until it got to you know as

3581
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,310
part of this until it got to you know as
as powerful a morality as we have. But

3582
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
as powerful a morality as we have. But

3583
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,669
as powerful a morality as we have. But
but in another way it would be

3584
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:51,679
but in another way it would be

3585
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,270
but in another way it would be
interacting with us and there'd be some

3586
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:53,280
interacting with us and there'd be some

3587
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,070
interacting with us and there'd be some
reason why it was different. Uh it it

3588
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
reason why it was different. Uh it it

3589
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,390
reason why it was different. Uh it it
would be um the fact that we had

3590
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,400
would be um the fact that we had

3591
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,229
would be um the fact that we had
different values from it would be um

3592
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:02,239
different values from it would be um

3593
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:05,669

uh a gift a gift from from pure

mathematics that there could be such a

3596
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
mathematics that there could be such a

3597
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,070
mathematics that there could be such a
thing because the first thing we would

3598
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
thing because the first thing we would

3599
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,470
thing because the first thing we would
do is to examine these values that it

3600
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:12,480
do is to examine these values that it

3601
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,310
do is to examine these values that it
had and the first thing it would do is

3602
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:14,320
had and the first thing it would do is

3603
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,790
had and the first thing it would do is
examine the values that we have and we

3604
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
examine the values that we have and we

3605
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,870
examine the values that we have and we
could learn from each other. Maybe

3606
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:18,880
could learn from each other. Maybe

3607
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,270
could learn from each other. Maybe
there's some good in each.

3608
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
there's some good in each.

3609
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,350
there's some good in each.
Why why would we why would that be the

01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
Why why would we why would that be the

3611
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,630
Why why would we why would that be the
first thing we'd both do?

3612
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:24,640
first thing we'd both do?

3613
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,470
first thing we'd both do?
&gt;&gt; If if if you if you find in in some

so this is I suppose what we've been

so this is I suppose what we've been

so this is I suppose what we've been

at least is what's called the

at least is what's called the

3631
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,790
at least is what's called the
orthogonality thesis. This idea that

be completely independent from which

3639
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,350
be completely independent from which
values you actually have. And I it see

01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,189

&gt;&gt; I can't remember tweeting that, but it
sounds like it was Bronovski and it was

3694
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
sounds like it was Bronovski and it was

3695
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,790
sounds like it was Bronovski and it was
Yeah. And um so he makes a number of

3696
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:16,800
Yeah. And um so he makes a number of

3697
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,709
Yeah. And um so he makes a number of
arguments about why scientific values

3698
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:20,719
arguments about why scientific values

3699
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,870
arguments about why scientific values
and moral values and also aesthetic

3700
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:22,880
and moral values and also aesthetic

3701
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,310
and moral values and also aesthetic
values are inseparable.

3702
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,320
values are inseparable.

3703
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,550
values are inseparable.
And uh one of the nicer arguments in uh

3704
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:30,560
And uh one of the nicer arguments in uh

3705
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,709
And uh one of the nicer arguments in uh
one of the mo most convincing arguments

3706
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:32,719
one of the mo most convincing arguments

3707
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,790
one of the mo most convincing arguments
I have found about scientific and moral

3708
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
I have found about scientific and moral

3709
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,750
I have found about scientific and moral
theories is that you can't do science

3710
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
theories is that you can't do science

3711
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,790
theories is that you can't do science
unless you subscribe to certain moral

3712
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
unless you subscribe to certain moral

3713
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,990
unless you subscribe to certain moral
values such as

3714
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
values such as

3715
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,990
values such as
um tolerance. Because science can't pro

3716
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,000
um tolerance. Because science can't pro

3717
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,070
um tolerance. Because science can't pro
progress very far without a scientific

3718
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
progress very far without a scientific

3719
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,470
progress very far without a scientific
community and a scientific community

3720
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
community and a scientific community

3721
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,430
community and a scientific community
can't progress unless it is tolerant of

3722
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:57,440
can't progress unless it is tolerant of

3723
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,910
can't progress unless it is tolerant of
deviant theories.

3724
01:23:59,910 --> 01:23:59,920
deviant theories.

3725
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,189
deviant theories.
So right uh so the the never mind

3726
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:03,199
So right uh so the the never mind

3727
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,189
So right uh so the the never mind
deviant moral theories just deviant

3728
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:05,199
deviant moral theories just deviant

3729
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,830
deviant moral theories just deviant
scientific theories.

3730
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:07,840
scientific theories.

3731
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,790
scientific theories.
So um if you if you want to be tolerant

3732
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
So um if you if you want to be tolerant

3733
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,229
So um if you if you want to be tolerant
of those you need to subscribe to the

3734
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
of those you need to subscribe to the

3735
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:18,390
of those you need to subscribe to the
value of tolerance in science at least.

3736
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:18,400
value of tolerance in science at least.

3737
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,750
value of tolerance in science at least.
So you know you're tolerant in the in

3738
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
So you know you're tolerant in the in

3739
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,629
So you know you're tolerant in the in
the seminar room and then when you go

3740
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639
the seminar room and then when you go

3741
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,350
the seminar room and then when you go
outside you you push aside everybody and

3742
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:27,360
outside you you push aside everybody and

3743
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,629
outside you you push aside everybody and
and in in the queue for lunch,

3744
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:30,639
and in in the queue for lunch,

3745
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,990
and in in the queue for lunch,
&gt;&gt; right? But but unless you obey the rules

3746
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
&gt;&gt; right? But but unless you obey the rules

3747
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,950
&gt;&gt; right? But but unless you obey the rules
inside the seminar room, society is

3748
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
inside the seminar room, society is

3749
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,030
inside the seminar room, society is
going to gr science is going to grind to

3750
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
going to gr science is going to grind to

3751
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,629
going to gr science is going to grind to
a halt.

3752
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:40,639
a halt.

3753
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,229
a halt.
&gt;&gt; So that that's one of Bronovski's

3754
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
&gt;&gt; So that that's one of Bronovski's

3755
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,550
&gt;&gt; So that that's one of Bronovski's
arguments and is very perceptive. I

3756
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
arguments and is very perceptive. I

3757
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,709
arguments and is very perceptive. I
think it's very true in in real life

3758
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:46,719
think it's very true in in real life

3759
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,470
think it's very true in in real life
because I think that

3760
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
because I think that

3761
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,950
because I think that
&gt;&gt; the conduct of scientists in seminar

3762
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
&gt;&gt; the conduct of scientists in seminar

3763
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,590
&gt;&gt; the conduct of scientists in seminar
rooms is much more moral than the

3764
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:53,600
rooms is much more moral than the

3765
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,590
rooms is much more moral than the
conduct of scientists outside seminar

3766
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
conduct of scientists outside seminar

3767
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,310
conduct of scientists outside seminar
rooms.

3768
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:58,320
rooms.

3769
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,550
rooms.
Yeah, I I Okay, I see how that would put

3770
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:02,560
Yeah, I I Okay, I see how that would put

3771
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,189
Yeah, I I Okay, I see how that would put
a crack in the orthogonality thesis. At

3772
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
a crack in the orthogonality thesis. At

3773
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,310
a crack in the orthogonality thesis. At
least those values and those abilities

3774
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
least those values and those abilities

3775
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,550
least those values and those abilities
cannot come apart. The value of

3776
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:10,560
cannot come apart. The value of

3777
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,350
cannot come apart. The value of
tolerance of new ideas and the people

3778
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
tolerance of new ideas and the people

3779
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,550
tolerance of new ideas and the people
expressing them.

3780
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
expressing them.

3781
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,350
expressing them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3782
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:15,360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3783
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And and the progress of science. But uh

3784
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,120
&gt;&gt; And and the progress of science. But uh

3785
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,270
&gt;&gt; And and the progress of science. But uh
it's it's you could still say the world

3786
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,280
it's it's you could still say the world

3787
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,030
it's it's you could still say the world
or this is a bad theory, but you could

3788
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,040
or this is a bad theory, but you could

3789
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,870
or this is a bad theory, but you could
say the orthogonality thesis holds

3790
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:24,880
say the orthogonality thesis holds

3791
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,669
say the orthogonality thesis holds
except for that. Yeah. Well, I I didn't

3792
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:27,679
except for that. Yeah. Well, I I didn't

3793
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,910
except for that. Yeah. Well, I I didn't
say that was Bronoski's only argument.

3794
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:29,920
say that was Bronoski's only argument.

3795
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,510
say that was Bronoski's only argument.
&gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter]

3796
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:31,520
&gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter]

3797
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,350
&gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Another argument of his is is that

3798
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:33,360
&gt;&gt; Another argument of his is is that

3799
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,669
&gt;&gt; Another argument of his is is that
another value that that science depends

3800
01:25:35,669 --> 01:25:35,679
another value that that science depends

3801
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,229
another value that that science depends
on is respect for truth.

3802
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:38,239
on is respect for truth.

3803
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:42,870
on is respect for truth.
So um again some people would say

3804
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:42,880
So um again some people would say

3805
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,990
So um again some people would say
science is only valuable if it is

3806
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:46,000
science is only valuable if it is

3807
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,390
science is only valuable if it is
directed towards

3808
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:48,400
directed towards

3809
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,030
directed towards
um the good of mankind or or something

3810
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:51,040
um the good of mankind or or something

3811
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,510
um the good of mankind or or something
or directed towards um um the

3812
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
or directed towards um um the

3813
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,510
or directed towards um um the
improvement of the economy or or

3814
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:57,520
improvement of the economy or or

3815
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,350
improvement of the economy or or
something like that. And um it's it's

3816
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:01,360
something like that. And um it's it's

3817
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,830
something like that. And um it's it's
now almost a truism that

3818
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:05,840
now almost a truism that

3819
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,790
now almost a truism that
science constrained in that way not only

3820
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:08,800
science constrained in that way not only

3821
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,110
science constrained in that way not only
does not approach truth very far, it

3822
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:13,120
does not approach truth very far, it

3823
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,430
does not approach truth very far, it
doesn't approve it doesn't improve the

3824
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:15,440
doesn't approve it doesn't improve the

3825
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,750
doesn't approve it doesn't improve the
value of the economy or human welfare or

3826
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:17,760
value of the economy or human welfare or

3827
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,790
value of the economy or human welfare or
anything that the the only way science

3828
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:20,800
anything that the the only way science

3829
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,950
anything that the the only way science
can improve is if if people are seeking

3830
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
can improve is if if people are seeking

3831
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,470
can improve is if if people are seeking
the truth,

3832
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
the truth,

3833
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,110
the truth,
&gt;&gt; not the ideas that best do something

3834
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:27,120
&gt;&gt; not the ideas that best do something

3835
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,629
&gt;&gt; not the ideas that best do something
else.

3836
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:28,639
else.

3837
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,470
else.
and the truth about morality.

3838
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,480
and the truth about morality.

3839
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,669
and the truth about morality.
Okay, again I I can't say in in

3840
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
Okay, again I I can't say in in

3841
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,310
Okay, again I I can't say in in
principle that there can't be a morality

3842
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:38,320
principle that there can't be a morality

3843
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,030
principle that there can't be a morality
that says you know we should pursue the

3844
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,040
that says you know we should pursue the

3845
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,870
that says you know we should pursue the
truth in mathematics and in science but

3846
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
truth in mathematics and in science but

3847
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,950
truth in mathematics and in science but
not in morality

3848
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:44,960
not in morality

3849
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,870
not in morality
not in other morality apart from the

3850
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:46,880
not in other morality apart from the

3851
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,790
not in other morality apart from the
morality of mathematics and the morality

3852
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:48,800
morality of mathematics and the morality

3853
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,550
morality of mathematics and the morality
of science.

3854
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
of science.

3855
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,229
of science.
Uh

3856
01:26:52,229 --> 01:26:52,239
Uh

3857
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,950
Uh
at the end of these arguments I've

3858
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:54,960
at the end of these arguments I've

3859
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,430
at the end of these arguments I've
always got to say yeah it could happen.

3860
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,440
always got to say yeah it could happen.

3861
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:57,830
always got to say yeah it could happen.
Mhm.

3862
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:57,840
Mhm.

3863
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,390
Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Um but I I see no sign of it and all the

3864
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,400
&gt;&gt; Um but I I see no sign of it and all the

3865
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,229
&gt;&gt; Um but I I see no sign of it and all the
things that are held up as examples of

3866
01:27:04,229 --> 01:27:04,239
things that are held up as examples of

3867
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,790
things that are held up as examples of
how it could happen are are examples of

3868
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:06,800
how it could happen are are examples of

3869
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,629
how it could happen are are examples of
the opposite.

3870
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:08,639
the opposite.

3871
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,550
the opposite.
&gt;&gt; One one example often brought up in the

3872
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
&gt;&gt; One one example often brought up in the

3873
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,950
&gt;&gt; One one example often brought up in the
orthogonality thesis is this idea of

3874
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
orthogonality thesis is this idea of

3875
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,750
orthogonality thesis is this idea of
Hitler that he he was very capable but

3876
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
Hitler that he he was very capable but

3877
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,709
Hitler that he he was very capable but
had completely aborant values.

3878
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
had completely aborant values.

3879
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,189
had completely aborant values.
on your worldview if Hitler was given

3880
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
on your worldview if Hitler was given

3881
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:25,430
on your worldview if Hitler was given
enough time uh to think that he would

3882
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
enough time uh to think that he would

3883
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,430
enough time uh to think that he would
eventually realize what he was doing was

3884
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
eventually realize what he was doing was

3885
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,709
eventually realize what he was doing was
wrong.

3886
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:28,719
wrong.

3887
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,030
wrong.
&gt;&gt; Well, um

3888
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
&gt;&gt; Well, um

3889
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,070
&gt;&gt; Well, um
if I think it would go thousands of

3890
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
if I think it would go thousands of

3891
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,910
if I think it would go thousands of
times faster if he could be imprisoned

3892
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:37,920
times faster if he could be imprisoned

3893
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,550
times faster if he could be imprisoned
somewhere where people could talk to him

3894
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
somewhere where people could talk to him

3895
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,590
somewhere where people could talk to him
and not allowed to make wars.

3896
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
and not allowed to make wars.

3897
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,990
and not allowed to make wars.
Um but yes, there's there's no reason to

3898
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:46,000
Um but yes, there's there's no reason to

3899
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,950
Um but yes, there's there's no reason to
believe that that uh Hitler was not an

3900
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
believe that that uh Hitler was not an

3901
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,590
believe that that uh Hitler was not an
AGI, was not a GI.

3902
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:51,600
AGI, was not a GI.

3903
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,070
AGI, was not a GI.
Um I think people who lose generality

3904
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:56,080
Um I think people who lose generality

3905
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,669
Um I think people who lose generality
um in their thinking are very noticeably

3906
01:27:59,669 --> 01:27:59,679
um in their thinking are very noticeably

3907
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:01,430
um in their thinking are very noticeably
different.

3908
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
different.

3909
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,030
different.
um

3910
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,040
um

3911
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,950
um
they do things like like um

3912
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
they do things like like um

3913
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,430
they do things like like um
not speak and and um or just do exactly

3914
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:11,440
not speak and and um or just do exactly

3915
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,750
not speak and and um or just do exactly
the same thing over and over again. I'm

3916
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,760
the same thing over and over again. I'm

3917
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,110
the same thing over and over again. I'm
not saying that people who don't speak

3918
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:15,120
not saying that people who don't speak

3919
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,590
not saying that people who don't speak
or do things over and over again are not

3920
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:17,600
or do things over and over again are not

3921
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,350
or do things over and over again are not
gis. Usually they are. But the ones who

3922
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,360
gis. Usually they are. But the ones who

3923
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,629
gis. Usually they are. But the ones who
aren't G gis will do things that require

3924
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:24,639
aren't G gis will do things that require

3925
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,870
aren't G gis will do things that require
no creativity. Even tying one's

3926
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:26,880
no creativity. Even tying one's

3927
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,310
no creativity. Even tying one's
shoelaces in the way that humans do

3928
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:30,320
shoelaces in the way that humans do

3929
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,910
shoelaces in the way that humans do
requires general intelligence.

3930
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:33,920
requires general intelligence.

3931
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,950
requires general intelligence.
&gt;&gt; Apes can't do it. They can they can tie

3932
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
&gt;&gt; Apes can't do it. They can they can tie

3933
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,550
&gt;&gt; Apes can't do it. They can they can tie
it so long as the laces are are, you

3934
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
it so long as the laces are are, you

3935
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,470
it so long as the laces are are, you
know, initially always in the same

3936
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
know, initially always in the same

3937
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,189
know, initially always in the same
configuration and so on, but they the

3938
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:45,199
configuration and so on, but they the

3939
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,550
configuration and so on, but they the
apes can't understand what laces do.

3940
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560
apes can't understand what laces do.

3941
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,430
apes can't understand what laces do.
&gt;&gt; They can only mimic and mimic the

3942
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
&gt;&gt; They can only mimic and mimic the

3943
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,430
&gt;&gt; They can only mimic and mimic the
non-purposeful parts of the action.

3944
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,440
non-purposeful parts of the action.

3945
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,950
non-purposeful parts of the action.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.

3946
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:54,960
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.

3947
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,510
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
Exactly.

3948
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
Exactly.

3949
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,229
Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Um, but Hitler could tie his shoelaces,

3950
01:28:58,229 --> 01:28:58,239
&gt;&gt; Um, but Hitler could tie his shoelaces,

3951
01:28:58,239 --> 01:28:58,870
&gt;&gt; Um, but Hitler could tie his shoelaces,
I assume.

3952
01:28:58,870 --> 01:28:58,880
I assume.

3953
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,870
I assume.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So that that's why I think

3954
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,880
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So that that's why I think

3955
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,189
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So that that's why I think
that's why I think he was a GI.

3956
01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:03,199
that's why I think he was a GI.

3957
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:05,189
that's why I think he was a GI.
&gt;&gt; Oh, was sorry I misheard.

3958
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:05,199
&gt;&gt; Oh, was sorry I misheard.

3959
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:05,510
&gt;&gt; Oh, was sorry I misheard.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3960
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:05,520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3961
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,990
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um

3962
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,000
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um

3963
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,550
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um
Okay. So GIS can be evil, [laughter] but

3964
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:12,560
Okay. So GIS can be evil, [laughter] but

3965
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,910
Okay. So GIS can be evil, [laughter] but
they'll eventually figure out that

3966
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
they'll eventually figure out that

3967
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,910
they'll eventually figure out that
they're being evil. And it could go a

3968
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
they're being evil. And it could go a

3969
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,310
they're being evil. And it could go a
lot quicker if they're talking to other

3970
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
lot quicker if they're talking to other

3971
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,550
lot quicker if they're talking to other
people. uh they're in dialogue just like

3972
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
people. uh they're in dialogue just like

3973
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,390
people. uh they're in dialogue just like
science goes much quicker if you're in

3974
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
science goes much quicker if you're in

3975
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,310
science goes much quicker if you're in
dialogue with other scientists.

3976
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:24,320
dialogue with other scientists.

3977
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:24,790
dialogue with other scientists.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

3978
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

3979
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,590
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Um and in the meantime we can restrict

3980
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600
&gt;&gt; Um and in the meantime we can restrict

3981
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,910
&gt;&gt; Um and in the meantime we can restrict
their actions uh to make sure they don't

3982
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
their actions uh to make sure they don't

3983
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,750
their actions uh to make sure they don't
do too much damage.

3984
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
do too much damage.

3985
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,870
do too much damage.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3986
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3987
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So it could be justified to

3988
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:35,840
&gt;&gt; Okay. So it could be justified to

3989
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,510
&gt;&gt; Okay. So it could be justified to
restrict an AGI until we were sure it

3990
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:39,520
restrict an AGI until we were sure it

3991
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,990
restrict an AGI until we were sure it
was on a similar path to us with its

3992
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
was on a similar path to us with its

3993
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,110
was on a similar path to us with its
values.

3994
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
values.

3995
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,030
values.
&gt;&gt; Uh it's the other way around. it would

3996
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
&gt;&gt; Uh it's the other way around. it would

3997
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:49,750
&gt;&gt; Uh it's the other way around. it would
be justified to restrict it if we were

3998
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:49,760
be justified to restrict it if we were

3999
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,910
be justified to restrict it if we were
sure that it was wasn't on a similar

4000
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:51,920
sure that it was wasn't on a similar

4001
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,189
sure that it was wasn't on a similar
path.

4002
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
path.

4003
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,470
path.
&gt;&gt; I see. You don't want to restrict it

4004
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:54,480
&gt;&gt; I see. You don't want to restrict it

4005
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,470
&gt;&gt; I see. You don't want to restrict it
until you're sure that it is.

4006
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:56,480
until you're sure that it is.

4007
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,790
until you're sure that it is.
&gt;&gt; This is a fundamental principle of the

4008
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
&gt;&gt; This is a fundamental principle of the

4009
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,390
&gt;&gt; This is a fundamental principle of the
enlightenment.

4010
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:00,400
enlightenment.

4011
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,510
enlightenment.
&gt;&gt; Uhhuh.

4012
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:01,520
&gt;&gt; Uhhuh.

4013
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,709
&gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
&gt;&gt; That that innocent until proved guilty.

4014
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
&gt;&gt; That that innocent until proved guilty.

4015
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,790
&gt;&gt; That that innocent until proved guilty.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

4016
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

4017
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,229
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.
I suppose I'm just nervous that

4018
01:30:10,229 --> 01:30:10,239
I suppose I'm just nervous that

4019
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:13,270
I suppose I'm just nervous that
humans I do think our values are large

4020
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:13,280
humans I do think our values are large

4021
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,510
humans I do think our values are large
are at least start off very informed by

4022
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,520
are at least start off very informed by

4023
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,750
are at least start off very informed by
the kind of intuitions we're born with.

4024
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:19,760
the kind of intuitions we're born with.

4025
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,590
the kind of intuitions we're born with.
I mean we are born with a kind of

4026
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:21,600
I mean we are born with a kind of

4027
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,550
I mean we are born with a kind of
intuitive physics of object permanence

4028
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
intuitive physics of object permanence

4029
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,390
intuitive physics of object permanence
and well okay that does actually come

4030
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
and well okay that does actually come

4031
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,189
and well okay that does actually come
later but there are some very basic

4032
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:29,199
later but there are some very basic

4033
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,229
later but there are some very basic
notions

4034
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:30,239
notions

4035
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,270
notions
&gt;&gt; that that are in built and humans start

4036
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,280
&gt;&gt; that that are in built and humans start

4037
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,510
&gt;&gt; that that are in built and humans start
off with with the same kind of record

4038
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:35,520
off with with the same kind of record

4039
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,830
off with with the same kind of record
&gt;&gt; and they lose them very fast

4040
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
&gt;&gt; and they lose them very fast

4041
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,870
&gt;&gt; and they lose them very fast
&gt;&gt; because they're wrong

4042
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
&gt;&gt; because they're wrong

4043
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,629
&gt;&gt; because they're wrong
&gt;&gt; un yeah unless they're true in which

4044
01:30:40,629 --> 01:30:40,639
&gt;&gt; un yeah unless they're true in which

4045
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,189
&gt;&gt; un yeah unless they're true in which
case they keep them [laughter] but but

4046
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:43,199
case they keep them [laughter] but but

4047
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:46,470
case they keep them [laughter] but but
uh it's a feature of gene and meme

4048
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:46,480
uh it's a feature of gene and meme

4049
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,510
uh it's a feature of gene and meme
evolution that once something can be

4050
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:49,520
evolution that once something can be

4051
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,510
evolution that once something can be
taken over by memes. There's no more

4052
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,520
taken over by memes. There's no more

4053
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,910
taken over by memes. There's no more
selection pressure for it to be encoded

4054
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
selection pressure for it to be encoded

4055
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,870
selection pressure for it to be encoded
in genes. So that decays that that um

4056
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
in genes. So that decays that that um

4057
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,910
in genes. So that decays that that um
thing decays and yeah I mean when when I

4058
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:01,920
thing decays and yeah I mean when when I

4059
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,430
thing decays and yeah I mean when when I
was a child I used to read uh comics

4060
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,440
was a child I used to read uh comics

4061
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:09,030
was a child I used to read uh comics
&gt;&gt; uh DC comics and Marvel comics and so on

4063
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,669
&gt;&gt; uh DC comics and Marvel comics and so on
and the entire adult world was trying to

01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:11,679
and the entire adult world was trying to

4065
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:14,310
and the entire adult world was trying to
stop me and [laughter]

4066
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:14,320
stop me and [laughter]

4067
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,310
stop me and [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry

&gt;&gt; and they are wrong for they were wrong

4079
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,229

for the same reason that people have

01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:48,639
&gt;&gt; Yes.

in different domains

4105
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,390

can progress at different rates.

4107
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,070
can progress at different rates.
And with humans, we don't progress at

01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,080
And with humans, we don't progress at

4109
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,149
And with humans, we don't progress at
the same rate in different domains, but

4110
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:06,159
the same rate in different domains, but

4111
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,310
the same rate in different domains, but
there is a kind of distribution that we

4112
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:08,320
there is a kind of distribution that we

4113

there is a kind of distribution that we
follow. We don't diverge arbitrarily

follow. We don't diverge arbitrarily

4115
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,830
follow. We don't diverge arbitrarily
much. Maybe in theory, we do, but in

tightly,

4123
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:24,070
tightly,
&gt;&gt; I guess. Although my progress in chess

4124
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,080
&gt;&gt; I guess. Although my progress in chess

4125
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,590
&gt;&gt; I guess. Although my progress in chess
uh and in in playing the piano and in

4133
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,790

&gt;&gt; but okay, that's that's still not as as

4135
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,790

big a difference as you could think

4137
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,870
big a difference as you could think

&gt;&gt; Yeah. [snorts]

4140
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:41,840
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [snorts]

&gt;&gt; Yeah. [snorts]
So when we when we produce new people,

4142
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
So when we when we produce new people,

4143
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,550
So when we when we produce new people,
we're selecting from that kind of

4144
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:46,560
we're selecting from that kind of

4145
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,510
we're selecting from that kind of
distribution. Um uh

4146
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
distribution. Um uh

4147
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,550
distribution. Um uh
When we produce new people,

4148
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:52,560
When we produce new people,

4149
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,470
When we produce new people,
um, we're we're giving them the same

4150
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:56,480
um, we're we're giving them the same

4151
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,270
um, we're we're giving them the same
infinite ability.

4152
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
infinite ability.

4153
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,470
infinite ability.
Once they're people or they're they're

4154
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:02,480
Once they're people or they're they're

4155
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,550
Once they're people or they're they're
all the same in regard to their infinite

4156
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560
all the same in regard to their infinite

4157
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,270
all the same in regard to their infinite
potential and they're all the same in in

4158
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:07,280
potential and they're all the same in in

4159
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,430
potential and they're all the same in in
regard to, as Papa says, in regard to

4160
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:09,440
regard to, as Papa says, in regard to

4161
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,830
regard to, as Papa says, in regard to
their infinite ignorance.

4162
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:11,840
their infinite ignorance.

4163
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,470
their infinite ignorance.
So, in that sense, they're all the same.

4164
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:14,480
So, in that sense, they're all the same.

4165
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,550
So, in that sense, they're all the same.
They may all have [clears throat]

4166
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:16,560
They may all have [clears throat]

4167
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,110
They may all have [clears throat]
slightly different qualia but that's

4168
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,120
slightly different qualia but that's

4169
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,990
slightly different qualia but that's
going to be u soon soon forgotten about

4170
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,000
going to be u soon soon forgotten about

4171
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,709
going to be u soon soon forgotten about
as they form their ideas.

4172
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
as they form their ideas.

4173
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,390
as they form their ideas.
&gt;&gt; So I mean they're they're equal in terms

4174
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:26,400
&gt;&gt; So I mean they're they're equal in terms

4175
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,990
&gt;&gt; So I mean they're they're equal in terms
of their reach in these different

4176
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:28,000
of their reach in these different

4177
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,310
of their reach in these different
domains that they're all infinite but

4178
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:30,320
domains that they're all infinite but

4179
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:30,709
domains that they're all infinite but
&gt;&gt; yes

4180
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:30,719
&gt;&gt; yes

4181
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,709
&gt;&gt; yes
&gt;&gt; for practical purposes they will

4182
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:32,719
&gt;&gt; for practical purposes they will

4183
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,629
&gt;&gt; for practical purposes they will
progress at different rates in these

4184
01:33:34,629 --> 01:33:34,639
progress at different rates in these

4185
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:35,110
progress at different rates in these
different

4186
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,120
different

4187
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,669
different
&gt;&gt; in different subject. Yeah. Yeah.

4188
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
&gt;&gt; in different subject. Yeah. Yeah.

4189
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,510
&gt;&gt; in different subject. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So if you if we build artificial

4190
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:41,520
&gt;&gt; Yes. So if you if we build artificial

4191
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,709
&gt;&gt; Yes. So if you if we build artificial
minds, they might be much

4192
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
minds, they might be much

4193
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,030
minds, they might be much
they might be outside this cluster of

4194
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,040
they might be outside this cluster of

4195
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,790
they might be outside this cluster of
different rates at which humans progress

4196
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:48,800
different rates at which humans progress

4197
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,629
different rates at which humans progress
in different domains. And so it's

4198
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
in different domains. And so it's

4199
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,990
in different domains. And so it's
possible that you could have some a mind

4200
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,000
possible that you could have some a mind

4201
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,110
possible that you could have some a mind
that makes much more rapid progress in

4202
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,120
that makes much more rapid progress in

4203
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:01,830
that makes much more rapid progress in
technology than in morality.

4204
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:01,840
technology than in morality.

4205
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,790
technology than in morality.
&gt;&gt; Uh yes.

4206
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:04,800
&gt;&gt; Uh yes.

4207
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,350
&gt;&gt; Uh yes.
uh just as with humans

4208
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,360
uh just as with humans

4209
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,550
uh just as with humans
&gt;&gt; right but it would be there's a larger

4210
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:10,560
&gt;&gt; right but it would be there's a larger

4211
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,470
&gt;&gt; right but it would be there's a larger
with humans it's from the same cluster

4212
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:12,480
with humans it's from the same cluster

4213
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,149
with humans it's from the same cluster
whereas from with AI it's

4214
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:14,159
whereas from with AI it's

4215
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,070
whereas from with AI it's
&gt;&gt; no I don't think they start with any

4216
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:16,080
&gt;&gt; no I don't think they start with any

4217
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,750
&gt;&gt; no I don't think they start with any
cluster

4218
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
cluster

4219
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:18,070
cluster
&gt;&gt; okay

4220
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
&gt;&gt; okay

4221
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,510
&gt;&gt; okay
&gt;&gt; yeah I I think the the the difference

4222
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
&gt;&gt; yeah I I think the the the difference

4223
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,390
&gt;&gt; yeah I I think the the the difference
between different babies is negligible

4224
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
between different babies is negligible

4225
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,910
between different babies is negligible
&gt;&gt; in terms of what they can achieve in

4226
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
&gt;&gt; in terms of what they can achieve in

4227
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,750
&gt;&gt; in terms of what they can achieve in
their life and how fast they'll go in

4228
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:27,760
their life and how fast they'll go in

4229
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,390
their life and how fast they'll go in
different domains

4230
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,400
different domains

4231
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,750
different domains
&gt;&gt; the difference in their starting ideas

4232
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
&gt;&gt; the difference in their starting ideas

4233
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,310
&gt;&gt; the difference in their starting ideas
&gt;&gt; Mhm. the like when they start they all

4234
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,320
&gt;&gt; Mhm. the like when they start they all

4235
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,910
&gt;&gt; Mhm. the like when they start they all
want to drink milk and and uh turn

4236
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:37,920
want to drink milk and and uh turn

4237
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,990
want to drink milk and and uh turn
towards sounds and you know whatever

4238
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,000
towards sounds and you know whatever

4239
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,790
towards sounds and you know whatever
their initial program is.

4240
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:42,800
their initial program is.

4241
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,350
their initial program is.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

4242
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,360
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

4243
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:47,990
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Um most of what baby animals can do they

4244
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
&gt;&gt; Um most of what baby animals can do they

4245
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,629
&gt;&gt; Um most of what baby animals can do they
have lost because because evolution has

4246
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
have lost because because evolution has

4247
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,189
have lost because because evolution has
decided it is better to let ideas decide

4248
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:53,199
decided it is better to let ideas decide

4249
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,830
decided it is better to let ideas decide
that rather than genes.

4250
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:55,840
that rather than genes.

4251
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,310
that rather than genes.
So most of those genes have but they

4252
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:58,320
So most of those genes have but they

4253
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,110
So most of those genes have but they
they have a bare minimum

4254
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:01,120
they have a bare minimum

4255
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,350
they have a bare minimum
&gt;&gt; uh genetic behaviors to make sure they

4256
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,360
&gt;&gt; uh genetic behaviors to make sure they

4257
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,510
&gt;&gt; uh genetic behaviors to make sure they
don't just die

4258
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
don't just die

4259
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,709
don't just die
um before they can you know

4260
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:08,719
um before they can you know

4261
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,629
um before they can you know
reach for things or whatever whatever

4262
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:10,639
reach for things or whatever whatever

4263
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:13,430
reach for things or whatever whatever
babies have to do first.

4264
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
babies have to do first.

4265
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,149
babies have to do first.
&gt;&gt; But uh the diversity is going to come

4266
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
&gt;&gt; But uh the diversity is going to come

4267
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,990
&gt;&gt; But uh the diversity is going to come
because they become different when

4268
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:18,000
because they become different when

4269
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,310
because they become different when
they're creative. So as soon as they are

4270
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:22,320
they're creative. So as soon as they are

4271
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,669
they're creative. So as soon as they are
soon certainly as soon as they're old

4272
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:23,679
soon certainly as soon as they're old

4273
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,950
soon certainly as soon as they're old
enough to speak, they will have

4274
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:26,960
enough to speak, they will have

4275
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,470
enough to speak, they will have
interests that are different from each

4276
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,480
interests that are different from each

4277
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,110
interests that are different from each
other and they are very strongly

4278
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:31,120
other and they are very strongly

4279
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,709
other and they are very strongly
different from each other. So that some

4280
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
different from each other. So that some

4281
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,470
different from each other. So that some
of them will enjoy doing things that

4282
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:34,480
of them will enjoy doing things that

4283
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:38,310
of them will enjoy doing things that
that others hate doing.

4284
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,320
that others hate doing.

4285
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,950
that others hate doing.
So um uh they're very different and but

4286
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:42,960
So um uh they're very different and but

4287
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,189
So um uh they're very different and but
they they they

4288
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
they they they

4289
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,189
they they they
converge

4290
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:47,199
converge

4291
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:51,350
converge
because they have access to other people

4292
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:51,360
because they have access to other people

4293
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,669
because they have access to other people
and to society

4294
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
and to society

4295
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,950
and to society
and um they converge to society partly

4296
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
and um they converge to society partly

4297
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,390
and um they converge to society partly
because th those are the raw material

4298
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,400
because th those are the raw material

4299
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,990
because th those are the raw material
for theories. you know, may as well go

4300
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,000
for theories. you know, may as well go

4301
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,750
for theories. you know, may as well go
for that theory if there's no other

4302
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:03,760
for that theory if there's no other

4303
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,390
for that theory if there's no other
theory going. But also because there's a

4304
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:06,400
theory going. But also because there's a

4305
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,830
theory going. But also because there's a
lot of truth in those theories.

4306
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
lot of truth in those theories.

4307
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,750
lot of truth in those theories.
&gt;&gt; So, uh, then they can become different

4308
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
&gt;&gt; So, uh, then they can become different

4309
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,030
&gt;&gt; So, uh, then they can become different
and then the difference will

4310
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,040
and then the difference will

4311
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,229
and then the difference will
show itself in some kind of conflict.

4312
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,239
show itself in some kind of conflict.

4313
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:25,910
show itself in some kind of conflict.
Um, but it it um it it won't, you know,

4314
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:25,920
Um, but it it um it it won't, you know,

4315
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,950
Um, but it it um it it won't, you know,
I I don't know. And uh it could be that

4316
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:28,960
I I don't know. And uh it could be that

4317
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,030
I I don't know. And uh it could be that
we're all doomed because of some glitch

4318
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:31,040
we're all doomed because of some glitch

4319
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,470
we're all doomed because of some glitch
in the fabric of reality. But but uh I

4320
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:34,480
in the fabric of reality. But but uh I

4321
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,629
in the fabric of reality. But but uh I
think the most likely thing is that they

4322
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
think the most likely thing is that they

4323
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,510
think the most likely thing is that they
will differ because one of them likes

4324
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
will differ because one of them likes

4325
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,870
will differ because one of them likes
playing the violin and the other one

4326
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:40,880
playing the violin and the other one

4327
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,390
playing the violin and the other one
likes playing the piano and the other

4328
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
likes playing the piano and the other

4329
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,109
likes playing the piano and the other
one likes doing physics and and the the

4330
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:45,119
one likes doing physics and and the the

4331
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:48,870
one likes doing physics and and the the
other likes um watching cartoons and and

4332
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:48,880
other likes um watching cartoons and and

4333
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,790
other likes um watching cartoons and and
so on. And uh all of them well many of

4334
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:52,800
so on. And uh all of them well many of

4335
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,229
so on. And uh all of them well many of
them will at some point say no I don't

4336
01:36:56,229 --> 01:36:56,239
them will at some point say no I don't

4337
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:59,910
them will at some point say no I don't
want to and most of them will be saying

4338
01:36:59,910 --> 01:36:59,920
want to and most of them will be saying

4339
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,790
want to and most of them will be saying
that about a different thing.

4340
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:02,800
that about a different thing.

4341
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,229
that about a different thing.
So and if they're all saying it about

4342
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
So and if they're all saying it about

4343
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:05,830
So and if they're all saying it about
the same thing then we ought to think

4344
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:05,840
the same thing then we ought to think

4345
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,350
the same thing then we ought to think
that maybe we're wrong. H

4346
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:09,360
that maybe we're wrong. H

4347
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,629
that maybe we're wrong. H
I I suppose that the the the last niggle

4348
01:37:12,629 --> 01:37:12,639
I I suppose that the the the last niggle

4349
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:15,430
I I suppose that the the the last niggle
I have is um

4350
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:15,440
I have is um

4351
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,430
I have is um
it seems possible that we could get a

4352
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:17,440
it seems possible that we could get a

4353
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,229
it seems possible that we could get a
human that

4354
01:37:20,229 --> 01:37:20,239
human that

4355
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,870
human that
just vastly

4356
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:22,880
just vastly

4357
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,590
just vastly
surpasses our ability at technological

4358
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,600
surpasses our ability at technological

4359
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,669
surpasses our ability at technological
progress and yet is

4360
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
progress and yet is

4361
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:31,590
progress and yet is
um not stunted. That would be the wrong

4362
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
um not stunted. That would be the wrong

4363
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,149
um not stunted. That would be the wrong
word. it would still be have unlimited

4364
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:34,159
word. it would still be have unlimited

4365
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:37,910
word. it would still be have unlimited
moral potential for moral progress, but

4366
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:37,920
moral potential for moral progress, but

4367
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,310
moral potential for moral progress, but
it just goes much more slowly. It chugs

4368
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
it just goes much more slowly. It chugs

4369
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,350
it just goes much more slowly. It chugs
along in that respect. And that seems

4370
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
along in that respect. And that seems

4371
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,510
along in that respect. And that seems
quite unlikely to happen with humans um

4372
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,520
quite unlikely to happen with humans um

4373
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,390
quite unlikely to happen with humans um
because we've seen 9 billion of them.

4374
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
because we've seen 9 billion of them.

4375
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,550
because we've seen 9 billion of them.
Well, many more now and we haven't

4376
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,560
Well, many more now and we haven't

4377
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,790
Well, many more now and we haven't
really seen that. Whereas with AIS, it

4378
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:54,800
really seen that. Whereas with AIS, it

4379
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,030
really seen that. Whereas with AIS, it
seems much harder to rule out that we

4380
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,040
seems much harder to rule out that we

4381
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:57,910
seems much harder to rule out that we
would have this.

4382
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:57,920
would have this.

4383
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,470
would have this.
&gt;&gt; We've seen the reverse.

4384
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:00,480
&gt;&gt; We've seen the reverse.

4385
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,550
&gt;&gt; We've seen the reverse.
We've seen uh people have people come up

4386
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:04,560
We've seen uh people have people come up

4387
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,910
We've seen uh people have people come up
with with either very good or very bad

4388
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
with with either very good or very bad

4389
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,390
with with either very good or very bad
moral theories.

4390
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
moral theories.

4391
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,149
moral theories.
&gt;&gt; Um

4392
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
&gt;&gt; Um

4393
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,470
&gt;&gt; Um
and if they're moral theories, then

4394
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:14,480
and if they're moral theories, then

4395
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,550
and if they're moral theories, then
they're going to come into conflict with

4396
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,560
they're going to come into conflict with

4397
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,310
they're going to come into conflict with
the surrounding theories. And then

4398
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:18,320
the surrounding theories. And then

4399
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,709
the surrounding theories. And then
you're going to have,

4400
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
you're going to have,

4401
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:25,189
you're going to have,
you know, Martin Luther uh nailing up uh

4402
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
you know, Martin Luther uh nailing up uh

4403
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:30,950
you know, Martin Luther uh nailing up uh
95 thesis on the door. And um and then

4404
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:30,960
95 thesis on the door. And um and then

4405
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,149
95 thesis on the door. And um and then
that's going to cause a a debate and in

4406
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
that's going to cause a a debate and in

4407
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,229
that's going to cause a a debate and in
a more decent society than what they had

4408
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
a more decent society than what they had

4409
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,430
a more decent society than what they had
then.

4410
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:37,440
then.

4411
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,070
then.
&gt;&gt; Um this is not going to lead to

4412
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
&gt;&gt; Um this is not going to lead to

4413
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,669
&gt;&gt; Um this is not going to lead to
violence.

4414
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,679
violence.

4415
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,669
violence.
Uh the fact that it led to violence then

4416
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
Uh the fact that it led to violence then

4417
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,310
Uh the fact that it led to violence then
just just shows you how how much

4418
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
just just shows you how how much

4419
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,390
just just shows you how how much
progress we've made since then

4420
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,400
progress we've made since then

4421
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,430
progress we've made since then
&gt;&gt; in the west.

4422
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:49,440
&gt;&gt; in the west.

4423
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,270
&gt;&gt; in the west.
&gt;&gt; In the west.

4424
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,280
&gt;&gt; In the west.

4425
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,350
&gt;&gt; In the west.
&gt;&gt; Um but you're going to say what? Yes.

4426
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,360
&gt;&gt; Um but you're going to say what? Yes.

4427
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,669
&gt;&gt; Um but you're going to say what? Yes.
But what if he's more different from our

4428
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
But what if he's more different from our

4429
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,830
But what if he's more different from our
society than Luther was from the

4430
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:57,840
society than Luther was from the

4431
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,149
society than Luther was from the
Catholic Church?

4432
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:00,159
Catholic Church?

4433
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,590
Catholic Church?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could. And again, you know, we

4434
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:03,600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could. And again, you know, we

4435
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,229
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could. And again, you know, we
and we couldn't. And and and

4436
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
and we couldn't. And and and

4437
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,270
and we couldn't. And and and
we we don't catch it. He and we don't

4438
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
we we don't catch it. He and we don't

4439
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,030
we we don't catch it. He and we don't
bother to talk about it while they're

4440
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:11,040
bother to talk about it while they're

4441
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,470
bother to talk about it while they're
still while we're still on the same page

4442
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:14,480
still while we're still on the same page

4443
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,470
still while we're still on the same page
in regard to being able to talk to each

4444
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:16,480
in regard to being able to talk to each

4445
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:20,070
in regard to being able to talk to each
other about it. And then suppose that in

4446
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
other about it. And then suppose that in

4447
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,510
other about it. And then suppose that in
the in the case that he's better he or

4448
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:23,520
the in the case that he's better he or

4449
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,070
the in the case that he's better he or
she is better uh or it I don't know what

4450
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
she is better uh or it I don't know what

4451
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,990
she is better uh or it I don't know what
what the custom will be by the time we

4452
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
what the custom will be by the time we

4453
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,149
what the custom will be by the time we
have AGIS

4454
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:32,159
have AGIS

4455
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:36,629
have AGIS
um will um be better at technology

4456
01:39:36,629 --> 01:39:36,639
um will um be better at technology

4457
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:42,149
um will um be better at technology
before we before before it or we notice

4458
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
before we before before it or we notice

4459
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:45,030
before we before before it or we notice
that something is going wrong

4460
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040
that something is going wrong

4461
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,590
that something is going wrong
uh with its morality

4462
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:47,600
uh with its morality

4463
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,510
uh with its morality
&gt;&gt; and and [clears throat] it it builds a

haven't managed to make a scenario that

4474
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
haven't managed to make a scenario that

4475
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,950
haven't managed to make a scenario that
could work even even in in terms of

01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:10,960
could work even even in in terms of

4480
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:13,760
science fiction. I mean even that

4481
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,229
science fiction. I mean even that
wouldn't end civilization.

4482
01:40:16,229 --> 01:40:16,239
wouldn't end civilization.

4483
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,199
wouldn't end civilization.
No, it's quite hard to end civilization

4484
01:40:18,199 --> 01:40:18,209
No, it's quite hard to end civilization

4485
01:40:18,209 --> 01:40:19,430
No, it's quite hard to end civilization

for good. And that that is is something

4488
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:21,840
for good. And that that is is something

01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,070
for good. And that that is is something
that differs from, you know, what's

that differs from, you know, what's
what's imaginable by far less than the

4492
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:27,840
what's imaginable by far less than the

4493
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,070
what's imaginable by far less than the
wars of the 20th century. They they were

4494
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,080
wars of the 20th century. They they were

4495
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,629
wars of the 20th century. They they were
much more destructive than than a person

4496
01:40:32,629 --> 01:40:32,639
much more destructive than than a person

4497
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,590
much more destructive than than a person
building an ICBMs and H bombs in their

4498
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
building an ICBMs and H bombs in their

4499
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,870
building an ICBMs and H bombs in their
backyard.

4500
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:38,880


4501
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,950
&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to make mistakes

4502
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to make mistakes

4503
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,709
&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to make mistakes
with this just like with every other

4504
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:44,719
with this just like with every other

4505
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:45,990
with this just like with every other
technology.

4506
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,000
technology.

4507
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,709
technology.
Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's one thing

4508
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:48,719
Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's one thing

4509
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:51,030
Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's one thing
I misunderstood when I first encountered

4510
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:51,040
I misunderstood when I first encountered

4511
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,790
I misunderstood when I first encountered
your views. It sounded like you were

4512
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
your views. It sounded like you were

4513
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,350
your views. It sounded like you were
saying we inex inexurably make progress

4514
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,360
saying we inex inexurably make progress

4515
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,189
saying we inex inexurably make progress
&gt;&gt; and things inexraably get better. And it

4516
01:40:59,189 --> 01:40:59,199
&gt;&gt; and things inexraably get better. And it

4517
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:00,550
&gt;&gt; and things inexraably get better. And it
took me a while to realize no, you're

4518
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:00,560
took me a while to realize no, you're

4519
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,070
took me a while to realize no, you're
not at all saying that.

4520
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:02,080
not at all saying that.

4521
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,149
not at all saying that.
&gt;&gt; We make mistakes. There's no no limit on

4522
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:04,159
&gt;&gt; We make mistakes. There's no no limit on

4523
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,310
&gt;&gt; We make mistakes. There's no no limit on
the size of mistake we can make.

4524
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:06,320
the size of mistake we can make.

4525
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,390
the size of mistake we can make.
&gt;&gt; But it's best to keep going and keep

4526
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
&gt;&gt; But it's best to keep going and keep

4527
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,430
&gt;&gt; But it's best to keep going and keep
trying. [clears throat]

4528
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
trying. [clears throat]

4529
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:13,990
trying. [clears throat]
That's a there's less existential risk

4530
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,000
That's a there's less existential risk

4531
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,790
That's a there's less existential risk
by keeping to make progress keep by

4532
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:16,800
by keeping to make progress keep by

4533
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,270
by keeping to make progress keep by
keeping making progress than there is

4534
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:19,280
keeping making progress than there is

4535
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:19,669
keeping making progress than there is
&gt;&gt; absolutely

4536
01:41:19,669 --> 01:41:19,679
&gt;&gt; absolutely

4537
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,510
&gt;&gt; absolutely
&gt;&gt; eliminating progress. [clears throat]

4538
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,520
&gt;&gt; eliminating progress. [clears throat]

4539
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,910
&gt;&gt; eliminating progress. [clears throat]
&gt;&gt; Not making progress makes um is the

4540
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:25,920
&gt;&gt; Not making progress makes um is the

4541
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,285
&gt;&gt; Not making progress makes um is the
existential risk that that that makes

4542
01:41:28,285 --> 01:41:28,295
existential risk that that that makes

4543
01:41:28,295 --> 01:41:31,830
existential risk that that that makes
[clears throat] um uh doom certain.

4544
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:31,840
[clears throat] um uh doom certain.

4545
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,709
[clears throat] um uh doom certain.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Because of the asteroid.

4546
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:34,719
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Because of the asteroid.

4547
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,030
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Because of the asteroid.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Or or or the more likely the thing

4548
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
&gt;&gt; Yes. Or or or the more likely the thing

4549
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,390
&gt;&gt; Yes. Or or or the more likely the thing
that we don't know about. Yeah. Yeah.
